<p>In the modern world, mobile applications have become an integral part of our lives. They simplify many aspects of our daily routines, providing access to various services, information, and entertainment. But what if we told you that mobile apps can also be a source of income for you? Yes, affiliate marketing in the realm of mobile apps offers a unique earning opportunity.</p>



<p>First and foremost, let&#8217;s understand what affiliate marketing is. It is a form of marketing in which you, as a marketer, promote products or services of other companies and earn a commission for each successful transaction or action taken by a user based on your recommendation. In the context of mobile apps, this means that you can promote apps developed by others and earn income based on their success.</p>



<p>We can see that the field of affiliate marketing continues to grow. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/693438/affiliate-marketing-spending/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Statista</a>, there is a constant increase in spending on traffic arbitrage in the United States each year. This confirms the presence of significant earning and growth opportunities. The key is to choose the right niche wisely.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-1024x656.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6378" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-1024x656.png 1024w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-300x192.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-768x492.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-1536x984.png 1536w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-470x300.png 470w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-740x474.png 740w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Affiliate marketing spending in the United States from 2010 to 2022 <em>(in billion U.S. dollars)</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Where to Begin?</strong></h2>



<p>Choosing the right niche and apps is a pivotal aspect of successful affiliate marketing. The market today presents various niches, and you should select those that align with your interests and competencies.</p>



<p>I will highlight three niches in which you can earn the most money:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Gambling Apps: A Winning Choice for Affiliate Marketing</strong></h2>



<p>Users frequently gravitate towards apps within genres like match-three, wheel of fortune, jackpots, treasure chests—essentially, anything associated with gambling and the allure of winning prizes and bonuses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6385" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2.png 800w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-300x232.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-768x594.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-740x573.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>Benefits for affiliate marketers in gambling:</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>High Earnings:</strong> Gambling apps offer some of the highest rates and commissions among all affiliate programs. This can lead to significant income if you have successful campaigns.</li><li><strong>Consistent Demand:</strong> The gambling industry typically experiences consistent demand, as people are always seeking opportunities for gambling entertainment and betting.</li><li><strong>Product Variety:</strong> Gambling apps offer a variety of products, from slots and poker to sports betting and virtual games. This allows affiliate marketers to choose products that align with their interests and target audience.</li><li><strong>Marketing Resources:</strong> Many gambling apps provide marketers with marketing resources such as banners, text ads, research materials, and other promotional materials to aid in their marketing efforts.</li></ul>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>Drawbacks for affiliate marketers in gambling:</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Strict Rules and Regulations:</strong> Gambling is subject to strict regulation and may be prohibited in certain regions. Affiliate marketers need to exercise caution and comply with the laws and regulations in their country and region.</li><li><strong>High Competition:</strong> The gambling niche typically experiences high competition, and marketers must compete for player attention and conversions.</li><li><strong>Reputation Risks:</strong> Gambling apps may have a questionable reputation, and collaborating with them can impact the marketer&#8217;s reputation.</li><li><strong>Financial Risks:</strong> Since affiliate marketers usually earn commissions based on player actions, there is a risk that marketers may not receive their commissions if players do not make deposits or incur losses.</li><li><strong>Market Dependency:</strong> Gambling apps can be subject to fluctuations in demand and market changes, which can affect the profitability of affiliate marketers.</li></ul>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Dating Apps: Flourishing Grounds for Affiliate Marketing</strong></h2>



<p>The dating niche is another arena where apps thrive. Dating apps facilitate the discovery of potential partners for relationships, dating, and communication. These apps furnish users with profiles of other individuals and the means to establish connections with those who pique their interest. Notable features may encompass search filters based on specific criteria, chat functionality, photo sharing capabilities, and compatibility analysis tools.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6386" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3.png 800w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-300x232.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-768x594.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-740x573.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>Benefits for affiliate marketers in dating:</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Steady Demand:</strong> In the dating industry, there is always a demand for dating services and dating apps. People are constantly seeking partners and opportunities to meet others.</li><li><strong>High Commissions:</strong> Dating apps can offer high commission payouts for each new registered user or paying customer, especially if it leads to long-term user activity.</li><li><strong>Wide Audience:</strong> Dating apps cater to diverse audiences, allowing affiliate marketers to choose niches and geographic regions that align with their interests and expertise.</li><li><strong>Diverse Products:</strong> The dating industry offers various products and platforms, including dating websites, mobile apps, chats, and other dating tools, giving marketers more options for promotion.</li></ul>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>Drawbacks for affiliate marketers in dating:</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>High Competition:</strong> The dating niche typically experiences high competition among affiliate marketers, making it challenging to attract traffic and conversions.</li><li><strong>Rules and Restrictions:</strong> Some dating apps and platforms may have strict rules and restrictions for affiliate marketers, including prohibitions on certain marketing methods.</li><li><strong>Content and Creativity:</strong> Appealing and effective marketing campaigns in the dating industry often require creative solutions and high-quality content, which may demand additional efforts.</li></ul>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Finance Apps: An Underrated Gem in Affiliate Marketing</strong></h2>



<p>I emphasize this niche as it often remains underappreciated. Financial apps are tailored for money management, banking transactions, and investments. These applications enable users to review account balances, initiate payments, delve into stock and fund investments, and monitor financial transactions. Furthermore, they often offer tools for budget planning and expense tracking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6387" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4.png 800w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-300x232.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-768x594.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-740x573.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>Benefits for affiliate marketers in financial apps:</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Steady Demand:</strong> The financial industry is always relevant because people are constantly interested in investments, savings, loans, and other financial products.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Potential:</strong> If you attract quality clients to financial apps, they can remain active users for an extended period, contributing to stable income.</li><li><strong>High Commissions:</strong> Financial apps, such as investment platforms, often offer high commission payouts for attracting new clients or investors.</li><li><strong>Educational Resources:</strong> Many financial companies provide educational resources and materials for marketers and their clients, helping with user acquisition and retention.</li></ul>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>Drawbacks for affiliate marketers in financial apps:</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Strict Rules and Regulation:</strong> The financial sector is subject to strict regulations, and marketers must comply with many rules and laws, which can limit marketing methods.</li><li><strong>High Competition:</strong> The financial niche often has high competition, and marketers need to compete for user attention and trust.</li><li><strong>Demanding Audience:</strong> Users of financial apps may be more demanding and cautious when choosing financial products, which can make conversions more challenging.</li><li><strong>Updates and Changes:</strong> Financial companies can make changes to their products and partnership terms, which can impact the marketer&#8217;s profitability.</li></ul>



<p>These niches are closely related to mobile apps, and many businesses are looking for affiliates to promote their products or services in exchange for rewards. Typically, companies incentivize partners to promote their products by providing them with a percentage of sales generated through their personal affiliate links, as in other affiliate reward programs.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>Rewards can vary in affiliate marketing for mobile apps:</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Install Commission:</strong> Some programs offer a commission for each app installation that a user completes through your unique link. This commission can be fixed or vary based on the user&#8217;s country.</li><li><strong>Registration Commission:</strong> You can earn a commission when a user registers in the app through your link. This method is especially suitable for apps that require registration.</li><li><strong>Purchase Commission:</strong> If the app offers paid services or products, you can earn a commission for each successful purchase made by users who came through your link.</li><li><strong>Affiliate Programs:</strong> Some apps have more complex affiliate programs that provide a commission for various user actions, such as watching videos, making in-app purchases, and other activities.</li><li><strong>Referral Bonuses:</strong> Some apps offer bonuses for both you and your referrals. This means that not only do you earn a commission for your referrals&#8217; actions, but the referrals themselves can also receive bonuses for installing and using the app.</li></ul>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Crafting High-Quality Content for Mobile App Affiliate Marketing</strong></h2>



<p>The next critical step in mobile app affiliate marketing involves the creation of top-notch content that not only captivates your audience but also persuades them to install and use the app. The pivotal elements here are the content&#8217;s informativeness and its distinctive nature.</p>



<ul><li><strong>App Reviews:</strong> Detailed app reviews are an excellent way to convey to users how an app can solve their problems or enhance their lives. Reviews should include a description of the key features, user-friendliness, and the benefits of the app.</li><li><strong>Articles on Benefits:</strong> Writing articles dedicated to the advantages of a specific app allows you to thoroughly explain how it can meet users&#8217; needs. Specify the problems the app solves and the unique features it offers.</li><li><strong>Video Reviews:</strong> Video content, such as video reviews, has significant potential for grabbing attention. Create informative videos that showcase how the app works, its interface, and practical usage. Videos allow users to visually understand the app.</li><li><strong>Content Uniqueness:</strong> It&#8217;s crucial to make your content unique and original. Avoid copying material from other sources and strive to bring something new and valuable to your users. Content uniqueness will enhance your credibility and attract more attention.<strong>Visual Presentation:</strong> Don&#8217;t forget about the visual presentation of your content. High-quality images and an attractive design will make your content more appealing and professional.</li></ul>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Optimizing ASO (App Store Optimization) for Affiliate Marketing Success</strong></h2>



<p>Analyzing Results: A Key Element in Affiliate Marketing</p>

<p>In today&#8217;s digital age, mobile apps have become an integral part of our daily lives. From social networking to gaming, education to entertainment, there&#8217;s an app for almost everything. However, with millions of apps available in the app stores, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly difficult for app developers to stand out from the competition and reach their target audience. This is where app marketing comes in &#8211; a crucial aspect of the app development process that can make or break an app&#8217;s success. In this article, <strong>we&#8217;ll explore the best practices for app marketing, focusing on how to effectively promote your app using both CPI and keyword installs</strong>. Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned app developer or a newcomer in the industry, read on to learn how to market your app and drive downloads.</p>



<ul>

<li><a href="#cpi"><u>What are CPI and keyword installs? The difference between both types</u></a></li>

<li><a href="#use"><u>What to use CPI campaigns for?</u></a> </li>

<li><a href="#combine"><u>How to combine CPI and keyword installs?</u></a></li>

</ul>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="cpi"><strong>What are CPI and keyword installs? The difference between both types</strong></h2>



<p>CPI (Cost Per Install) is a type of mobile app advertising model where advertisers pay a fee each time their app is installed by a user. In other words, it&#8217;s the cost an advertiser pays for each app installation generated through the ad campaign.</p>



<p>CPI campaigns are commonly used to promote mobile apps, particularly on social media platforms and mobile ad networks. Advertisers typically bid for ad space and target specific audiences based on demographic information, interests, and behaviors. When a user clicks on the ad and installs the app, the advertiser is charged the agreed-upon CPI rate.</p>



<p>One of the <strong>benefits of CPI campaigns</strong> is that advertisers only pay for actual app installations, rather than for impressions or clicks. This means that advertisers can more accurately measure the success of their app marketing campaigns and optimize their strategy for better results. However, it&#8217;s important for advertisers to carefully track and analyze CPI data to ensure that they&#8217;re getting a good return on their investment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>As you may notice while using our service, we offer CPI campaigns for Google Play apps. So if to sum up, CPI campaign at <a href="https://Appsmm.ru/buy-app-installs">Keyapp</a> is a tool used to attract users to your app. These users are not motivated with gems or coins as those who install your app when you order keyword installs. These users will install your app only if they like it. <strong>That means you will attract people who generate in app activity and income for you.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-52-1024x628.png" alt="CPI campaign on Appsmm.ru" class="wp-image-5795" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-52-1024x628.png 1024w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-52-300x184.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-52-768x471.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-52-740x454.png 740w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-52.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>CPI campaign on Appsmm.ru</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Keyword installs are app downloads that occur when a motivated user searches for a specific keyword or phrase in the app store and then finds and installs the needed app. <strong>This type of promotion helps increase the app&#8217;s ranking in the search results for that keyword,</strong> as the app store algorithm recognizes it as becoming more popular for that specific search request.</p>



<p>App developers use keyword campaigns to make their apps more visible and attract more organic downloads from users who search for related keywords. These organic downloads are highly valuable as they come from users who are actively searching for apps related to the keyword, indicating a higher likelihood of retention and conversion. By optimizing their app for keywords and increasing their ranking in the search results, developers can increase their app&#8217;s visibility and attract more users.</p>



<p>Keyword installs are an effective way to promote an app because they target users who are actively searching for apps related to a particular keyword or topic. This means that users who download an app through a keyword search are likely to be more engaged and interested in the app&#8217;s content. Additionally, because advertisers only pay for actual app installations, keyword installs can be a cost-effective way to promote an app.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-6-1024x428.png" alt="Keyword campaign on Appsmm.ru" class="wp-image-5797" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-6-1024x428.png 1024w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-6-300x125.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-6-768x321.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-6-740x309.png 740w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-6.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Keyword campaign on Appsmm.ru</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The difference between both types of traffic is that they are aimed at solving different needs that app developers may have while promoting their apps on Google Play. CPI campaigns are aimed at increasing in-app activity and expanding the user base through advertising. While keyword installs are aimed at helping your application get higher positions in the search results, which gives it a chance to be downloaded by relevant users who are looking for different search requests on the store. This type of promotion already solves the problem of organic traffic attraction, while the final aim is the same for both types of downloads &#8211; to expand the user base and increase the app revenue. </p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="use"><strong>What to use CPI campaigns for?</strong></h2>



<p>Although App Store Optimization and keyword promotion are commonly emphasized by us as key marketing tools, CPI campaigns can be a valuable solution for addressing various issues that may arise during the promotion of your Google Play app. Let’s consider the main ways to can add CPI campaigns to your marketing strategy.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>1) CPI campaigns may be used to expand the app user base</strong></p>



<p>As we have already mentioned, CPI installs are generated from ads shown on different websites, etc. At the same time, it may be needed for app developers to attract more users and generate in-app activity, which, of course, will lead to an increase in revenue they get. CPI campaigns are one of the main aims to get more downloads at a lower cost. For example, as you may know, while setting up the CPI campaign campaign, to choose the regions you would like the ads with your app to be shown. You can choose any region from the world&#8217;s countries, or even set up a worldwide promotion to attract users from all over the world. Such a wide range of available regions for promotion gives you the possibility to attract users for low cost if to choose the region with low cost per install. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-564-1024x795.png" alt="The example of CPI regions on Appsmm.ru" class="wp-image-5799" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-564-1024x795.png 1024w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-564-300x233.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-564-768x596.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-564-385x300.png 385w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-564-740x575.png 740w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-564.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>The example of CPI regions on Appsmm.ru</em></figcaption></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>2) CPI campaigns may be used to improve user acquisition</strong></p>



<p>CPI campaigns can significantly improve user acquisition for your app by targeting users who are more likely to install and engage with it. By doing so, you can attract new users who are genuinely interested in your app&#8217;s features and functionalities, leading to increased engagement and revenue.</p>



<p>One effective strategy to improve user acquisition through CPI campaigns is to target users who have already shown an interest in similar apps or categories. For instance, if you have a photo editing app, you can target users who have previously installed other photo editing apps or have demonstrated an interest in photography or design. Another approach is to target users who share similar usage patterns with your existing users or have previously engaged with your app. This can be achieved through lookalike targeting, which uses data about your current user base to identify new users who are likely to be interested in your app.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>3) CPI campaigns may be used to promote newly-launched apps</strong></p>



<p>CPI campaigns are a valuable tool for promoting a new app. When launching a new app, it can be challenging to attract new users and gain visibility among the millions of other apps in the app store. CPI campaigns can help overcome this challenge by promoting your app to a wider audience and encouraging more people to install and engage with it.</p>



<p>One advantage of CPI campaigns for new app launches is that they are cost-effective and can help you reach your target audience quickly. By paying only for successful installations, you can avoid wasting your advertising budget on users who may not be interested in your app or may not convert into loyal users.</p>



<p>Another benefit is that CPI campaigns allow you to target specific demographics and interests, ensuring that your ads are seen by users who are most likely to be interested in your app. This can be particularly important for new apps that may have a specific niche audience or target market.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>4) CPI campaigns may be used to get into the index for keywords</strong></p>



<p>CPI campaigns are one of the ways to get the indexation for search requests on Google Play after you released the app. As you know, the main factor influencing the success of the indexation process on Google Play is qualitatively done App Store Optimization, but do not forget about the way the Google Play algorithm works to give your app maximum chances to be ranked in the top 250.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you could remember from our previous articles, the Google Play algorithm pays a lot of attention to app metrics while deciding whether to index the app or not, as well as to increase the app rank for a particular keyword or not. That’s why, after the ASO is done and app is successfully published (even several weeks ago) you may find out that it still cannot be found by any keywords on the store. At this stage, it is already high time to think about using CPI campaigns. If to talk shortly, Google Play needs to see that the application has some in-app activity and users to be able to put it into the index for search requests. By the way, you can read <a href="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/app-promotion/how-to-index-app-keywords/">how we managed to get into the index for search requests with a new application using CPI traffic</a>. </p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="combine"><strong>How to combine CPI and keyword installs?</strong></h2>



<p>You often ask us if it is appropriate to run CPI and keyword campaigns simultaneously for Google Play apps. And our answer is always YES! This marketing strategy will give your application the maximum result in terms of increasing your user base and app revenue. Let’s consider two main ways you can combine these types of campaigns.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>1) Use CPI campaigns for new applications to get into the index for keywords</strong></p>



<p>As we have mentioned before, the Google Play algorithm needs several factors to give the new application the rank for search requests: </p>



<ul><li>App Store Optimization (keywords should be added to the title, short and long description)&nbsp;</li><li>In-app activity and user engagement (algorithm should understand that the application is “alive” and generates some traffic) </li></ul>



<p>Using CPI campaigns for new applications can be an effective strategy for getting your app to rank for specific keywords. As mentioned earlier, CPI campaigns can help generate initial traction and increase the number of downloads for your app, which in turn can help boost its visibility and ranking in the app store.</p>



<p>When launching a new app, it can be difficult to rank for competitive keywords as there are many other established apps that are already ranking for those keywords. However, by using CPI campaigns to increase the number of installs for your app, you can signal to the app store algorithm that your app is gaining traction and popularity. This can help your app rank higher in search results for specific keywords.</p>



<p>Of course, it is not possible to get top ranks for keywords only using CPI, as they are not keyword targeted, but this type of traffic will help your application get into the top 250, which gives the possibility to use keyword installs with the aim of increasing the ranks for specific search requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most common question is if it is necessary to get the CPI installs from the region you would like to index your application for keywords in. To be honest, it&#8217;s not obligatory. While your aim is to get into the top 250, you can try to set up the CPI campaign for different regions. Let’s imagine that you have released the app and would like to get into the top 250 for keywords in the United Kingdom. As you could know, CPI installs may go from three types of regions depending on the cost per install: </p>



<ul><li>Low CPI geos</li><li>Middle CPI geos</li><li>High CPI geos</li></ul>



<p>The United Kingdom is considered to be a region of high CPI so to attract the users from this geo you may need to set the cost per install of minimum 0.40-0.50$. At the same time, there are a lot of countries where low CPI is applied, like India, Pakistan, Ethiopia, etc. You can easily launch the campaigns for such countries with a minimum cost per install which will give you the possibility to get into the index in the United Kingdom as well since Google needs to see the overall in-app activity no matter what country it goes from (although ordering installs directly from the United Kingdom in CPI campaign can give higher chances for indexation)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-2-1024x861.png" alt="Low CPI countries" class="wp-image-5800" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-2-1024x861.png 1024w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-2-300x252.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-2-768x646.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-2-740x622.png 740w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-2.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Low CPI countries</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s consider this short example. The following app was promoted using the CPI campaign two weeks after it was launched. The main aim of promotion using this type of promotion was to get into the top 250 for keywords in Tier 1 countries. Here are the results in the number of clicks, impressions and downloads the campaign gave as well as the regions chosen for promotion. The total number of installs received is 2201 during 6 days with the average CPI of 0.07$ from low CPI regions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5-3-1024x631.png" alt="results in the number of clicks, impressions and downloads the campaign gave as well as the regions chosen for promotion" class="wp-image-5801" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5-3-1024x631.png 1024w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5-3-300x185.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5-3-768x473.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5-3-740x456.png 740w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5-3.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Before the CPI campaign, the application was indexed for the next keywords in the following countries</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Frame-96.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Frame-96-1024x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5806" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Frame-96-1024x300.png 1024w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Frame-96-300x88.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Frame-96-768x225.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Frame-96-740x217.png 740w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Frame-96.png 1230w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>After the CPI campaign the application managed to get into the index for more requests and expanded the keyword cloud</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/6-5-1024x328.png" alt="New indexed keywords for the USA" class="wp-image-5807" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/6-5-1024x328.png 1024w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/6-5-300x96.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/6-5-768x246.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/6-5-1536x492.png 1536w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/6-5-740x237.png 740w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/6-5.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>New indexed keywords for the USA</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7-6-1024x331.png" alt="New indexed keywords for Canada" class="wp-image-5808" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7-6-1024x331.png 1024w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7-6-300x97.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7-6-768x248.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7-6-1536x496.png 1536w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7-6-740x239.png 740w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7-6.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>New indexed keywords for Canada</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The next stage here is how to proceed while the application gets into the index for first keywords and whether it is needed to stop the CPI campaign at this point. Definitely, no. When the app gets into the rank for the keywords, you can already start to promote them with keyword installs as well as continue using the CPI. This will give even better results as the app will be indexed for new requests, as well as in-app activity and user engagement will influence the success of keyword promotion, which will be discussed next.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>2) Use CPI campaigns to make the keyword promotion more successful</strong></p>



<p>We always try to remember the importance of app metrics in keyword promotion on Google Play as this is one of the most widespread mistakes, thinking that applications can occupy top ranks for search requests only using keyword promotion and not paying attention to in-app activity and retention rate. To avoid the main mistakes in app promotion, read the following <a href="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/app-promotion/5-mistakes-each-app-developer-may-do-before-starting-game-app-keywords-promotion/">article</a>.</p>



<p>CPI campaigns have a positive impact on keyword position increases on Google Play. When users install an app through a CPI campaign, it signals to Google Play&#8217;s algorithm that the app is relevant and valuable to users. This can result in an increase in app visibility and improved keyword rankings.</p>



<p>When an app is installed through a CPI campaign, it can also lead to increased engagement and retention. This, in turn, can lead to more positive reviews and ratings, which can further improve keyword rankings and overall app visibility.</p>



<p>Additionally, CPI campaigns can help increase app installs and drive more traffic to the app store listing, which can also positively impact keyword position. As more users engage with the app and leave positive ratings/reviews, Google Play&#8217;s algorithm may recognize the app as high-quality and relevant for certain keywords, leading to higher rankings for those keywords.</p>



<p>All these facts should be taken into consideration when you conduct keyword promotion using keyword installs. Yes, obviously, keyword installs are a powerful tool to boost the ranks, and in a lot of cases, it is not possible to occupy the top ranks in the search list only using ASO techniques and CPI traffic. At the same time, CPI campaigns may “support” your keyword promotion strategy by giving an app the users who will stay and create high conversion and retention rates, as well as increasing the app&#8217;s reputation (do not forget, that for getting such an impact from CPI campaigns, the application should be optimized and meet the user expectations not consisting any crushes).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s consider several examples of positions increasing while keyword promotion with and without CPI campaigns. </p>



<p>The following application was promoted for the keyword “text translator” in Australia. At the same time, the apps got installs from the CPI campaign in Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries. As you may see, the promotion process for the keyword was quite fast, and the application managed to achieve the top 1 two days after the campaign.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-01-1024x547.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5809" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-01-1024x547.png 1024w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-01-300x160.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-01-768x410.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-01-1536x820.png 1536w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-01-740x395.png 740w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-01.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The next app was promoted for the keyword “translate free” with the daily volume of keyword installs although it was managed to achieve only the top 20. While analyzing the results, it was discovered that the app didn’t get any additional paid traffic (such as CPI) and organic downloads, as well as had a low retention rate. Of course, keyword downloads did the effect and the application increased in rank, but the results could be much more successful if it had a higher level of in-app activity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-02-1024x547.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5810" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-02-1024x547.png 1024w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-02-300x160.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-02-768x410.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-02-1536x820.png 1536w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-02-740x395.png 740w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/graph-02.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h2><strong>SUM UP</strong></h2>



<p>To sum up, the combination of CPI campaigns and keyword installs can be an effective marketing strategy to improve your app&#8217;s visibility and user acquisition. The use of CPI campaigns to target specific audiences can generate initial traction, while keyword installs can help improve your app&#8217;s visibility and keyword rankings, leading to increased organic traffic and user engagement. It&#8217;s important to remember that these strategies should not be used in isolation. Instead, they should be viewed as complementary approaches that work together to achieve your app marketing goals. By carefully planning and executing both strategies, you can maximize your app&#8217;s potential for success and improve your overall marketing ROI.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>STAGES OF APPLICATION PROMOTION</strong><br />
Creating any product starts with an idea. It should be fresh and interesting for the potential consumer. Creative idea &#8211; the main step to success. It doesn’t matter whether you choose a popular category of applications or not. After all, a good product and the right promotion can lead to the creation of a personal group, as is the case with the famous «Pokemon GO», which received a separate category of «additional reality».</p>
<p>Getting directly to the development of the application, you already need to think about its «sale». If you wish to promote the product in the global market, we advise you to pay attention to its localization &#8211; the creation of an English interface or the possibility of choosing a language.</p>
<p>Next, the finished application is placed on the service. At the same time it is necessary to follow the ranking rules &#8211; take into account the factors of ASO (description, logo-icon, keywords). The optimal description should intrigue the user with a short form of text (up to 80 characters) and convince of the need to download the application as an advanced version.</p>
<p><em><strong>The product logo is the first thing that is paid attention to, therefore, when creating it, it is worthwhile to fulfill the following design requirements:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>The icon should be memorable and unique;</li>
<li>The logo should not contain many small details, «load» with superfluous information;</li>
<li>You can use no more than two primary colors.</li>
<li>Properly selected keywords will also help improve performance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7 PROMOTION STRATEGIES</strong><br />
The success of the product is to occupy high positions in the overall ranking. The greatest impact on it has the number of downloads and reviews, which can be obtained with proper promotion.</p>
<p><strong>The most effective techniques:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Using paid services to get an initial rating;</li>
<li>Contextual advertising on Google, covering a wide Central Asia and bringing a slow, but lasting effect;</li>
<li>Preparation of reviews, and even better their order from advanced popular bloggers;</li>
<li>Using affiliate programs &#8211; placing links with a description of the application;</li>
<li>Promotion through social networks (relevant for games);</li>
<li>An increase in the number of reviews for an additional fee;</li>
<li>Creation of special non-competitive applications (satellites) that will promote your product.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> For any of the listed methods, at least a minimum budget is needed, then the effect will be quicker.</strong></p>
<p>In order for affiliate programs to produce results, you need to track the number of conversions in Google Analytic. Thus, it will be possible to identify more profitable partner web resources.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USERS’ FEEDBACK </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2012, all reviews left on Google Play belong to real people. There are now services where you can purchase reviews. To use such services or not is your choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google does not explicitly state that if they notice that you are paying people for feedback, they will delete your application. It makes sense to turn to such services when your application is not popular enough to rise at the expense of organics. And it really works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more civilized way to get more reviews will be the message «<em>Do you like the game? Rate us!</em>». There are a couple more tricks, about them another time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">INSTALLS</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s an interesting thing &#8211; if you persuaded a hundred of your friends to install the application on the first day after launch, you have the chance to loom all over the next day in the Top Gaining Top in your small but proud country. If you are lucky and if your game is good enough, there is a chance to consolidate your success. More installs &#8211; higher rating. Higher rating &#8211; more installs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the application rises to the top by itself! This is exactly what you should strive for, bearing in mind, though, that the top «Gaining Popularity» is not shown in every Google Play interface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also known that the data in Google Play is collected and evaluated for the month. Applications with good dynamics of installs are raised in the rating (and they are lowered from the bad one, we do not forget about it). Thus, it is necessary to maintain acceleration for a month (or at least not to drop), and it will be easier to hold on the next month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RATES</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more the better. Good rates are better than the bad ones. A lot of average ratings are better than a few good ones. At one of the mobile conferences, LinguaLeo shared a successful, experienced enhancement of metrics on mobile devices and came to interesting conclusions that the average rating is higher than four stars does not affect anything. This roughly corresponds to the perception of a typical user: five stars — a miracle, four stars — OK, three stars — sucks, two stars — failure, one star — it did not run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RELEASE DATE AND UPDATE</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best results have the applications that were published less than a month and more than two years ago. Applications that were updated less than a month ago, go to a higher position. From this, you can make a very reasonable and correct conclusion that your app needs to be updated at least once a month, especially since no one will keep you waiting for two weeks and finding faults in each screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">APPLICATION NAME</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The keywords used in the name of the application have the greatest weight. Here you have two ways: on the side of good and on the side of evil. Real Jedi give their application a unique name, make a brand out of it and promote it, as well as at the expense of the quality and usefulness of their application, in order to become leaders by so-called «brand inquiries». If you are still on the way to a Jedi dedication or you have many competitors, you can add two or three relevant keywords to the second part of the application name, separating it with a dash or a hyphen. It is advisable to make a meaningful phrase out of these words so that your ASO-efforts are not too striking to ordinary users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DESCRIPTION</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Google Play application description page is optimized according to the same ASO laws that apply to regular searches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a suspicion that ASO descriptions will be even more useful if you simultaneously optimize the content of the application. This functionality was launched in the public domain not so long ago. Such promotion is suitable for a directory application or magazine, but it will be difficult to implement for a game with three screens and a leaderboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">INTEGRATION WITH GOOGLE +</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives of the company promise mountains of gold to those who have integrated Google Plus, up to the special selection of the editors of Google Play. There are no real cases of the «golden mountains», if there are any, it will be interesting to discuss them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VIDEO</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This factor is positive anyway, especially if this video is good. On the other hand, if you have the opportunity to record a decent video, then, most likely, you have a good enough application, and you have already taken into account other issuing factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON AND SCREENSHOTS</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an indirect factor, which in itself is not related to ranking, but rather strongly affects the number of organic installs. Despite a large number of tools for previewing and A / B testing, this part of optimization still remains an art rather than a science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, three tips on how to improve icons and what works almost always:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Use simple geometric shapes;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Use no more than three colors, select them by the color circle;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do not try to be original &#8211; choose the simplest solution;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimization of the description of applications is a cunning and long process in which success ultimately depends on the application itself. The main thing in this business is the adequate perception of your product, and also the readiness to cooperate and listen to others, be it the opinion of a despicable marketer, the assessment of the majority of users or, finally, Google analytics. It is for her to have the last word in all matters related to the optimization of the description on Google Play.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone who creates their mobile application dreams to achieve success. </span><b>How to do it?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We will tell you about the three main points below.</span></p>
<p><b>ITEM 1. RESEARCH: REQUIREMENTS AND COMPETITIVENESS </b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check into the app stores, go to the Google Play Store to see which apps attract attention and gather the largest audience. Are there any role models to follow, perhaps something will push you to a completely new idea. Google Play Store and iTunes make app ratings, so you can easily find the most popular ones.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a list of popular apps that may be relevant to your industry activities. It is widely known that messengers (apps with which you can communicate in real time mode) and keyboard simulators, especially for Android-devices, are very popular. Every self-respecting developer considers it his duty to release his version. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, you can rush into chasing the leader.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Saturation of the market does not mean that success will pass you by.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>ITEM 2. PLANNING: ACCURACY IN DETERMINING THE GOAL</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, high competition nullifies all attempts to break into the top in-app ratings, however, this does not mean that you spent time in vain, exploring mobile app stores. You got an idea of what is popular and now you have an idea of what exactly people need and start working in this direction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about the main tasks of your app &#8211; about the audience. It is impossible to grasp the immensity. Your app has to cope with one or two tasks, but it has to do this </span><b>great</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this impression in the app works absolutely everything:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> design, sounds, even the lack of possibility to correct typos.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not decide on goals and objectives, then you are necessarily among outsiders. It is impossible to succeed simply by cloning a known service. </span><b>Look for your own «chips».</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>ITEM 3. CREATIVITY: SEARCHING FOR GENIUS IDEAS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If people do not like your product, then do not expect someone to install your app. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you involve a celebrity in cooperation?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Excellent! Think about how you can use a known name, what in common can there be between it and the application that you create. For example, a famous golfer, even if he has finished a professional career, can help in the promotion of your unique golf messenger.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do mobile apps make money? They need to be sold! But remember: too little price for your mobile app simply does not cover the cost of its creation. But too high a price tag can simply scare off potential buyers. You should think about how you will earn money before you start promoting your mobile app.</span></p>
<p><b>There are only a few ways to monetize your product:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotion inside the app;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The payable version of your product;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying inside your app;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>INSIDE APP PROMOTION</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The application is promoting with a special ad, which encourages you to purchase the full version of the program. If the user wants to get rid of obsessive advertising, then he can calmly do it. It is enough to pay a certain amount that you ask. Many experts consider this method to be one of the most popular among those who want to enrich themselves on their own development. What is its peculiarity? It seems to the user that such advertising is part of the application itself, it is unobtrusive and responds to it more. This way of earning is suitable not only for large companies but also for new developers.</span></p>
<p><b>PAYABLE VERSION</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second option is to sell your product in Google Play and the App Store. That is, the user installed your app for the specified price, and you received a percentage for this. Just remember what to share. So, Apple takes a commission of 30% from each sale of your app. The same amount will have to pay if you have a product for Android. Now with Google Play, installed several times more apps than with the App Store.</span></p>
<p><b>BUYING INSIDE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can sell additional and new features directly from the app. Just think, no one will want to buy new funny stickers for communication or a miracle helmet for passing a new level in the game. As a rule, additional functions are divided into low-cost, medium-price and premium-class. For example, users can use VIP-functions for a dollar per day, but it will be more profitable to pay for premium access for a month &#8211; for example, for 25 conventional units.</span></p>
<p><b>HOW MUCH DOES IT APPLY?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The figures are really very different. So, about 30% of developers received for their works from 1$. Someone was luckier and he earns several thousand dollars every month.</span></p>
<p><b>AS A FACT</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are real record-breakers. For example, in May 2013 Vietnamese developer Dong Nguyen released a simple game «Flappy Bird». There everything is simple &#8211; we need to make sure that the bird travels between the pipes. So, for the advertising inside his toy bird, the developer received 50,000$ a day. It inspires, doesn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But do not forget that apps are like kids. That is, they require constant attention, correction of mistakes, updating, and promotion. Mobile applications can not only help you personally, as a developer. But also become the engine of your business.</span></p>
