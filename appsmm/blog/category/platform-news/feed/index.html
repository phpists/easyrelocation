<p>We added a new type of review to our platform. You can now buy app reviews that stay longer on your app’s page. Appsmm.ru guarantees that high-quality reviews stay 30 days and longer. When you place an order, we promise that more than 80% of the reviews will stay after the order is finished. We do these reviews with a 5-star rating, so more of the reviews stay on the market.  </p>



<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How to make these reviews stay forever on your app page? </h2>



<ul><li>Prepare original texts that reflect users’ experience with your product. Write in your main keywords but omit spam words, promo codes, and special symbols. Texts should be unique, simple, and without span.</li><li>Do not order a lot of reviews a day. Spread the reviews throughout 5-7 days, with some 5-10 reviews a day.&nbsp;</li><li>Combine reviews orders with traffic acquisition. When you order 10 reviews, launch a Facebook or Google Ads campaign with some 200-250 acquired users per day from the same region you order reviews. Our reputation management will look natural and more reviews will stay in place.&nbsp;</li><li>Like and comment on the reviews in 4-5 days&#8217; time. Respond to the reviews you ordered on our platform. </li></ul>



<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What can your app achieve with our reviews? </h2>



<ul><li>Better rating and reputation. With a higher mark, you get a better chance to promote and become at the top of your category on the market. At the same time, a better reputation means a higher CR (conversion rate) into download from the app page.</li><li>Additional keywords in the index. You can write texts with your relevant search requests or brand names of your competitors. Follow our guides, so you do not risk your reviews overspamming your texts.&nbsp;</li><li>Our reviews do not ruin your application. More than 80% of the reviews you order from us will stay on the app page. It means that you will need fewer incentive reviews, and your manipulations will look less suspicious for the market algorithm. </li></ul>



<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How to place the review order? </h2>



<p>Go to <a href="https://my.Appsmm.ru/login?page=hqrcampaign">“Add reviews High Quality”</a> and place an order. Choose your number of reviews per day. 5-10 installs per day will be an optimal number for an application in any region. Pick the region and upload the texts. We can write the texts for you if you do not have them. </p>



<p>We need to make some preparations before we actually review your texts and place the feedback about your product. It will take up to 24 hours. Keep in touch with your Personal Manager or ask our Support Team to assign one. He or she will help you with orders and promotions. </p>

<p><b>Let&#8217;s take a look at the search section a little closer. </b>Literally, you can understand it like this:</p>
<p id="UlWdYXT"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1731 " src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf69f67230.png" alt="" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf69f67230.png 851w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf69f67230-300x223.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf69f67230-768x570.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf69f67230-740x550.png 740w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf69f67230-80x60.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px" /></p>
<p>And you can already see the <b>keyword search queries</b> with data on the conversion in the install and ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)<b> </b>for this keyword.</p>
<p id="ogMzpjP"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1732 " src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf7185e7dc.png" alt="" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf7185e7dc.png 1031w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf7185e7dc-300x159.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf7185e7dc-768x408.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf7185e7dc-1024x544.png 1024w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf7185e7dc-740x393.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 1031px) 100vw, 1031px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After conducting this analysis, you will be able to choose the right a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pp’s keywords</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be promoted. </span><b><i>Note:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rely on «First-time installers» indicators more than on «Store listing visitors». It is important to see by which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Play keywords</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people install your app better. Don’t hesitate to take a look on conversion rate (written below in percentages), it will show you which keyword helps your target client to find what they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, our app was searched for the keywords «drawing games» and «how to draw dresses step by step». The «drawing games» keyword had 264 views and 47 installs, which means 17.8% conversion. Well, «how to draw dresses step by step» keyword had 128 views and 35 installs, which means that it is 41.4%. </span><b>As we see, the second keyword is more relevant for our app by users opinion.</b></p>
<p><b>Don’t worry if your application is low in rank by chosen Google Play keyword! The most effective way to increase your application rank is </b><b>to use incentive installs via keywords</b><b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">That will help your app to become more visible for users eye in GP search. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>HOW Appsmm.ru RELATES TO THIS CHANGES?</b></p>
<p><b>Appsmm.ru provide a unique service &#8211; keyword incentive installs.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This option helps Google Play customers to find searchable applications much easier, especially when you do it with right </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Play keyword</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><b> Let’s take a look at Appsmm.ru strategy example.  </b><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><b>we took an app</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> «File Manager» </span><b>and create a campaign with the most relevant keywords.</b></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1733 " src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf757231d3.png" alt="" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf757231d3.png 718w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf757231d3-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px" /></p>
<p><b>We started to promote it with 2 medium competitive keywords </b>«file» and «total commander», which have a good rank and received a lot installs during the month.</p>
<p id="LOsIRJQ"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1734 " src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf78a9c5b0.png" alt="" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf78a9c5b0.png 793w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf78a9c5b0-300x48.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf78a9c5b0-768x124.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf78a9c5b0-740x119.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" /></p>
<p>After 5 days the application has been promoting, it grew up in the ranks. For example:</p>
<p>By the word «file», the application was on the 51 place. <b>After promotion had finished application grew for 31 positions.</b></p>
<p id="MLppoKs"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1735 " src="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf7d55c389.png" alt="" srcset="https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf7d55c389.png 793w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf7d55c389-300x81.png 300w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf7d55c389-768x207.png 768w, https://Appsmm.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdaf7d55c389-740x200.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" /></p>
<p><b>So, updated Google Developer Console is important for understanding:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What keywords bring the installs;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What keywords are better converted into installs?</span></li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>The other day the Google Chrome browser celebrated its 10th anniversary! In the original publication of September 1, 2008, which is still stored in the company&#8217;s blog, a new approach to the web browser was proclaimed.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>INTERESTING FACT</strong><br />
Chrome was launched on September 2 as a beta version for Windows &#8211; a stable build appeared in December. In the next 2009, in December, the browser got to the beta version before Linux and Mac OS. Chrome made its debut at a time when developers and Internet users are increasingly breaking with Internet Explorer, and the popular version of Firefox has grown steadily.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S THE FEATURE OF GC?</strong><br />
Idea! The idea of ​​creating a &#8220;sandbox&#8221; for each separate tab of the browser, so that the envy of one page does not lead to the failure of other tabs. This helped improve speed and stability. Chrome as a whole, combined with the JavaScript JavaScript engine V8 from Google, which the company has constantly improved to increase the speed of complex web applications.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENED?</strong><br />
Over the past decade, a truly grandiose path has been taken &#8211; now the browser dominates and became the main website for most Internet users. Even in the desktop sector, Chrome currently occupies more than 60%, and engineers continue to improve it with new features and promote the latest Web standards. But Chrome has turned into something more than just a web browser &#8211; today it&#8217;s a whole platform that runs on top of Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and even iOS. Given the dominance of the Android operating system on the mobile market, its built-in Chrome browser naturally also leads. By the way, the first version of Chrome for Android was released in February 2012.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S NEXT?</strong><br />
The future of Chrome is more like a platform, not just a modest web browser. Sometimes expressed fears that Chrome is turning into a new Internet Explorer 6 because of its dominance among web developers (Google Android). It is optimized in this web browser. Google engineers continue to develop and implement the most advanced, in their opinion, Web standards in Chrome and other browser developers have to make up for lost time or lag behind Google.</p>
<p><strong>SO</strong><br />
Many may have the impression that Chrome exists even longer than 10 years &#8211; such a significant way was passed during this time. Chrome Blink, including Opera, Steam, Samsung Internet and so on. Team Chrome said that on September 4 in honor of a significant anniversary will be an announcement of something special. If you had forgotten, what would you have done?</p>
