								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Here you may find out the most important changes which last year brought ASO specialists and app developers both on Google Play and AppStore. We tried to tell about as many updates as possible so you are aware of how to work with stores now to get the best possible results from ASO, keywords promotion and app reputation management. </p>



<p>Google Play and AppStore algorithms are being updated all the time and both you, as app developers and ASO specialists, and we, as a service which helps you to get higher positions for the keywords and increase app reputation, cannot influence this. But anyway, that is not the reason to stop development, marketing and promotion of the apps. We know that we face such an issues all the time, so would like to discuss what changes the last yeat has brought to Google Play and AppStore (yeah, we know that it is not the end of the year yet, but probably this info will be useful for everyone who works with the apps). </p>



<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What changes and updates have we observed on AppStore?</strong></h2>



<p> ●  We suppose that the most important update Apple gave ASO specialists this year is the possibility to conduct A/B tests os app icons, screenshots and videos as well as text metadata with the help of App Analytics in AppStore Connect. </p>



<p>This feature helps you, as an app developer, conduct any A/B tests faster and without the spendings for the alternative service who provide such possibility. All the data of the tests is available in your AppStore Connect where you will find the results showing the app page visiting and installs. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/configure-test-treatments-large_2x.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/configure-test-treatments-large_2x-1024x942.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4571" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/configure-test-treatments-large_2x-1024x942.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/configure-test-treatments-large_2x-300x276.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/configure-test-treatments-large_2x-768x707.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/configure-test-treatments-large_2x-1536x1413.png 1536w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/configure-test-treatments-large_2x-740x681.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/configure-test-treatments-large_2x.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption> Source https://developer.apple.com </figcaption></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p> ●  AppStore gave the possibility to create custom app pages. This feature allow to create up to 35 app pages which could be shown to different types of users. For example, you may create the special page for moms with small children and show to them this page, so in such a way you will get the most relevant traffic. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_2-2.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_2-2-1024x631.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4572" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_2-2-1024x631.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_2-2-300x185.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_2-2-768x473.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_2-2-740x456.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_2-2.png 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption> Source https://developer.apple.com </figcaption></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p> ●  AppStore gave the possibility to create In-App events. This feature allows to tell your app users about any coming events in your app. Imagine, that you have an app where users should to compete with each other. You may create an event which will be shown on the app page, in the search results, in personal recommendations, and your users will get known that the particular event event, for example, the great tournament in the game, is coming. One more important thing about in-app events &#8211; their title (30 symbols) and short description (50 symbols) are indexed by AppStore! </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_3-1.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_3-1-1024x691.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4573" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_3-1-1024x691.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_3-1-300x203.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_3-1-768x518.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_3-1-740x500.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_3-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption> Source https://developer.apple.com </figcaption></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p> ●  There is also an update from AppStore in the search results list. Now all the downloaded apps for devices with iOS 15 are displayed without the screenshots. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/screenshot_4_1-473x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4548" width="200" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/screenshot_4_1-473x1024.jpg 473w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/screenshot_4_1-139x300.jpg 139w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/screenshot_4_1.jpg 591w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p> ●  Search Ads Popularity (SAP) became available for the China region. As you may know, Search Ads Popularity shows the keyword weight on the store. The higher SAP is, the more popular the keyword is. </p>



<p>Pay attention, that stores don’t only have different changes with time passing, but their algorithms are working differently as well both for optimization and promotion. Read this <a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/app-promotion/difference-between-google-play-and-appstore-algorithms/">article</a> for more details.</p>



<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What changes and updates have we observed on Google Play?</strong></h2>



<p>  ●  The biggest update from Google Play we faced during last year is, of course, the reduction of title length from 50 to 30 symbols like on AppStore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was the biggest update and everyone was worried how this would influence the apps positions fro keywords and the overall app performance. We can tell that most our clients, of course, change the title and some positions were lost, although we helped to get them back. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_5-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4555" width="600" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_5-1.png 599w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_5-1-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p> ●  Google Play started to group reviews according to the region, not only device language. Previously, if you had English as a device language, you saw the reviews from the users who had English as well and no matter what country they were from. But since November 2021 Google changed this and now you see the reviews from the users from your country.</p>



<p>Of course, this has influenced the rate displaying as well, as now you see the middle rating of the app in your country, not in the whole world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All these updates are available in Developer Console as well where you can filter the reviews and rates according to the region.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_6-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4553" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_6-1.png 600w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_6-1-300x233.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_6-1-385x300.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_7-2.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_7-2-1024x433.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4554" width="600" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_7-2-1024x433.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_7-2-300x127.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_7-2-768x324.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_7-2-740x313.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_7-2.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p> ●  Google Play has updated the interface in the web version in most Asian countries. Now there is the following interface: </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_8_1.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-4" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_8_1-1024x400.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4556" width="600" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_8_1-1024x400.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_8_1-300x117.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_8_1-768x300.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_8_1-740x289.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_8_1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>As you can see, there is no list of 250 apps in web version for these geos anymore, although the list of apps on mobile devices stayed the same. </p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p> ●  Google started to show even deleted reviews with the link.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you know, we provide high quality reviews with guarantee and the main option to check if the reviews is alive was to follow the link we provide as a report. In January 2022 we have noticed that if you have the link to the review, you can follow it and see the text, even if the review is deleted and not available on the app page.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_9.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4557" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_9.png 600w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_9-300x65.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p> ●  Google has changed the list of apps in web version in March 2022.</p>



<p>We have noticed that from March 2022 there are only 50 apps in web version of Google Play if you look for any keyword. To see all the apps you need to press “All results”. This didn’t influenced the list of apps on mobile devices, there are still 250 apps.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_10_1.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-5" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_10_1-1024x590.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4558" width="600" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_10_1-1024x590.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_10_1-300x173.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_10_1-768x443.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_10_1-740x426.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_10_1.png 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>These are the most important updates for both stores which we noticed. They are connected with ASO, reviews and stores updates. We know that algorithm are updated all the time and sometimes it is so difficult to follow them, but do not worry, we are here and check the situation on the stores all the time so to be informed and inform you as our client. Do not hesitate to contact our managers to get the latest updates of promotion strategies! </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>GOOGLE PLAY STORE IS WAITING FOR THE NEXT DESIGN CHANGE</h2>
<p>Google is gradually leading to a single design of all its mobile (and not only) services and applications. Soon, another redesign awaits the Play Store application store, although one cannot say that it has not been updated for a long time.</p>
<p><img src="https://telegra.ph/file/19427bee9109870842489.png" /></p>
<p>You should not wait for a cardinal transformation, but the application will become more concise with fewer colors in the design of the elements. Actually, many other Google applications have undergone the same metamorphosis over the past year.</p>
<p><img src="https://telegra.ph/file/7f83e091ff3a90495a413.png" /></p>
<p>You can also note some changes directly in the location, shape and availability of various labels and menu items. When to wait for the update is unclear.</p>
<h2>ANDROID START UPDATED THROUGH GOOGLE PLAY</h2>
<p>For more than three years now, Google has been trying to make Samsung, LG, Huawei, Xiaomi, Meizu, Motorola, HTC and many other manufacturers get new <a href="https://aso.keyapp.top/">Android</a> operating systems shortly after their release, but nothing like that, unfortunately , still not happening. Whatever the search giant has come up with, electronics manufacturers are doing everything to update the software as slowly as possible in their phones, which is why it was decided to bet on Google Play.</p>
<p>On April 16, 2019, the Android operating system began to be updated through the Google Play application store. So far, only owners of Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 phones can test the innovation, because in this way the “search giant” distributes the latest build of the Android 10.0 Q test firmware, the final build of which should be available for download to everyone in August of this year. It is quite obvious that installing updates through the store is significantly more convenient than anything else.</p>
<p><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/a39HRh2zBqJG/source.gif" /></p>
<p>Thus, Google hopes to make the process of releasing Android updates centralized for all smartphones and tablets, and third-party electronics manufacturers will be able to use this opportunity in 2019, that is, in the coming months. To install the update, simply launch the Google Play store and then go to the “Updates” section, where there is a separate menu responsible for updates for the operating system installed on the phone. Google is not advertising this innovation at all, but it’s understandable, since the presentation of the Android 10.0 Q operating system will take place in early May, and now only its early test builds are available to users. I want to believe that the centralized update of all smartphones through the G Play store will affect not only the products of manufacturers, which will receive a new OS, but also one that works on Android 9.0 Pie and Android 8.1 Oreo. Like it or not &#8211; will be known very soon.</p>
<h2>GOOGLE PLAY PROTECT FAILED TEST FOR EFFICIENCY</h2>
<p><img src="https://telegra.ph/file/1ea6c3af5f0820003eb1a.png" /></p>
<p>As shown by the results of recent testing of antivirus solutions for Android, Google Play Protect alone is not enough to protect the device from cyber threats.</p>
<p>Researchers at AV-TEST analyzed 19 antivirus products for efficiency, functionality, and usability. For each of the three characteristics, the application received an appropriate rating &#8211; a maximum of 6 points for efficiency and usability and 1 point for functionality.</p>
<p>AhnLab V3 Mobile Security, Avast Mobile Security, AVGAntivirus Free, ESET Endpoint Security, Kaspersky Lab Internet Security for Android, Sophos Mobile Security, Symantec Norton Mobile Security and Trend Micro Mobile Security received the highest rating of 13 points. All of them received 6 points for efficiency and user-friendliness and 1 point for functionality and demonstrated almost perfect performance.</p>
<p>Products from Bitdefender, F-Secure, G Data, McAfee and SK Telecom were rated at 12.5 points each.</p>
<p>The lowest score of three points received only one application &#8211; Google Play Protect. Three points were awarded to him for ease of use, but for the effectiveness and functionality of Google Play Protect received a zero.</p>
<p>During testing, the ability to block malicious files in real-time mode, the application blocked only 62% of malware, while the average for other antiviruses is 97.8%. As for blocking new malware that appeared in the last four weeks, the result was slightly better &#8211; 69.2%. However, the average for other solutions is 98.2%.</p>
<p>During the installation and use of legitimate applications from the Google Play Store, the antivirus issued 189 false positive warnings.</p>
<h2>THE NUMBER OF THREATS IN GOOGLE PLAY HAS DOUBLED DURING THE YEAR OUT OF THE CLICK FRAUD</h2>
<p>Google experts have published a report on threats in the Android ecosystem for 2018. As it turned out, the number of Malvari in Google Play continues to grow and almost doubled over the year. However, experts claim that there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>The fact is that the main reason for the increase in the number of Malvari is “potentially dangerous applications”, which now also includes a click fraud (adware). Previously, such ad-abusing applications were considered to only violate the rules of the catalog, now they are regarded as complete malware and fairly “spoil the statistics”: in 2017 there were only 0.04% of such applications, in 2018 they were already 0.2%.</p>
<p>At the same time, if you exclude the  click fraud  from the collected statistics, it turns out that the number of installations of potentially dangerous applications from Google Play for the year decreased by 31%. The most common victims of such applications are users from the United States, Brazil and Mexico.</p>
<p>According to the report, adware currently makes up 55% of all potentially dangerous programs in the official Google directory. The second line of the “rating” behind advertising malware is occupied by Trojans, which have gained only 16%.</p>
<p>But outside the official Google Play catalog, according to the company, the situation is much worse. So, for the year, the protection of Play Protect prevented the installation of 1.6 billion potentially dangerous applications and 73% of them were not from Google Play.</p>
<p>Also outside of Google Play, the list of topical threats also looks a little different: applications with backdoors (28%) and trojans (25%) lead in the lead, and adware has only 13% of the total number of malicious programs. Applications with backdoors are most often detected on devices of users from Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It should be noted that researchers associate backdoor infections with the Chamois application, which some manufacturers often preinstall on their devices, and this, in turn, loads other malware into the system.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Google says that in the coming weeks, the company will update e-mails that it communicates with developers in which they will &#8220;better&#8221; explain their decisions, including clarifying information about why the decision was made to deny publication, how applications can be changed to meet the requirements and how to file an appeal. If necessary, they will also include a statement of appeals together with the appropriate forms.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;From the very beginning, we wanted to make Android a fully open operating system &#8230; This developer-oriented approach and openness from the very beginning were the cornerstones of Android philosophy,&#8221; says Samer Samat, vice president of product management on his blog. &#8211; &#8220;But with the growth and development of the platform, every decision we make was compromised &#8230; We have always taken this responsibility seriously to our users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google will also add more live reviewers to its app review team to &#8220;speed up&#8221; and make the &#8220;personalized&#8221; appeals process more.</p>
<p>In addition, the company will strengthen the analysis of applications from new developers, without the reputation that will allow them to reduce the number of erroneous solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although more than 99% of our blocking decisions are correct, we are very sensitive to errors,&#8221; Samat writes.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will have a positive impact on both developers and google play users, so let&#8217;s see how it goes!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOOGLE PLAY POWERFULLY UPDATED. </span><b>WHAT&#8217;S NEW? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a service called Google Play that allows you to download applications and games to gadgets running the Android operating system from there for many years now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This software is directly installed on all models of mobile devices that are sold outside of China, while in the Chinese territory Play Market is blocked due to a number of reasons. January 30, 2019, the «search giant» has updated its offspring, making it more convenient to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of the updated Google Play took place, which over the next few days will be installed on Android smartphones automatically. At first glance, it seems that nothing has changed, but in reality, this is far from the case. Previously, various additional sections were available directly to users on the main page, allowing them to quickly get to the music, movies, TV shows, and other digital content, but now you can find only two tabs there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From now on, you can quickly switch to Google Play only between applications and games, which are placed in two different sections. Such measures are aimed at gradually abandoning the secondary content that enjoys modest popularity among users of Android-based devices. In this case, access to sections with movies, music, and other content is still possible, but now you have to do it through the side menu. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As some professionals believe in the future Google will continue to gradually abandon secondary content in its store, and it will do this until all the main emphasis is placed on games and applications, while other digital content can, in general, to disappear from there, because it will be moved to another separate application. Most likely, the «search giant» seeks to bring order to the company Play Marker, making it more convenient and easy for users, such as the App Store for the iPhone and iPad.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>These are the recent news! Google Play Allegedly Developing &#8216;Play Points&#8217; Loyalty Program as we know one way to encourage customers to make repeat purchases is by rewarding their loyalty. Most movie theaters have a points program in place, and so do many credit cards. It looks like Google will be doing the same thing. There is evidence to suggest that <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/google" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google</a> is working on a Play Points loyalty program for users who make purchases at its <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-bans-all-cryptocurrency-mining-apps-play-store" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Play Store</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>This is a totally new thing for app stores as there is no such program that is currently at any of the major app stores, including Google&#8217;s Play Store, <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/apple" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple&#8217;s</a> App Store, or <a href="https://hothardware.com/search?s=microsofts" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft&#8217;s</a> Windows Store.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>How do we know that they started working on it?</strong></div>
<div>Here it is. There are strings of text in various Play Store APKs that reference the loyalty program. The first references came in version 11.5, with one of the strings reading, &#8220;Introducing Google Play Points.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>&#8220;Earn points on everything you buy. Use points for special in-app items or Google Play credit,&#8221; another string stated.</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>As currently written, the loyalty program consists of several reward tiers, or &#8220;Levels,&#8221; each with their own set of benefits. There are at least five Levels in all, which appear to be ranked as bronze, silver, gold, and perhaps platinum and titanium.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>There are much more other details. But the basic concept is that Play Store users will be able to earn and track points. Once earned, those points can be redeemed for Play Store credit and/or used to purchase in-game items. It&#8217;s not clear if users will earn points simply by shopping, or if there will be other ways of racking up points.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>It&#8217;s not clear when Google might roll this out. Bear in mind that even though there are references to a loyalty program in the APK, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it will 100% will be presented on Google Play. But, t&#8217;s an interesting move, especially after <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/epic-games" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Epic Games</a> opted not to make <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/fortnite" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fortnite</a> available in the Play Store. That decision could have Google missing out on <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-could-lose-50-million-revenue-without-fortnite-play-store" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$50 million in revenue</a>, or more, from the 30 percent cut of sales it collects.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google is jeopardizing the millions of Android users around the world, the story of the existence of a vulnerability in the Fortnite installation client. Despite the fact that the developers got rid of the gaps in the shortest time, not all managed to install a patch with a patch to protect themselves.</p>
<p><em>We asked Google not to disclose information publicly until most users updated the patch. They refused, exposing Android users to unnecessary risk, but they got a cheap PR</em>,<br />
<strong>&#8211; wrote the CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney.</strong></p>
<p>Despite the fact that Fortnite, explains CEO, the process of installing it is activated only when the game is launched. Therefore, if a user launches Fortnite once a week, hackers will have exactly seven days to make an attack by initiating the download of malicious components.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s desire to heat Epic Games is quite obvious. Because of the studio&#8217;s failure to host the game Fortnite on Google Play, the search giant received millions of dollars in commission form, which was from every transaction in the catalog. On the other hand, there is no purely technical guilt in Google&#8217;s actions, as the company warned Epic Games about the bug, giving it time to fix it.</p>

Arcade games that do not require special skills &#8211; a dime a dozen. However, often for simplicity lies the most real hardcore. It will take some time to understand the intricacies of control and get a little farther than the first tower: in Icy Ropes you will have to manage two characters connected by the same chain (more precisely, the rope).</p>
<p>3. Orbia<br />
The game is the complete opposite of the previous one. At least, at the very beginning. This is a bright representative of the &#8220;time-boiling&#8221;, where the gamer needs a bit of spatial imagination and a good reaction. In the rest, the brain can relax and go into rest. You only need to move from one outlined area to another, tapping on the display to launch the &#8220;hero.&#8221; Manage the character is not necessary, he will choose the direction. The main thing is to press the screen in time.</p>
<p>4. Selfissimo!<br />
An application that uses advanced algorithms to capture selfies. You can change the facial expression and position of the body, but once it is locked, the program automatically takes a picture. That is, now you do not have to drag your finger to the button and thus spoil the potential masterpiece or set a timer and wonder if it will work in time.</p>
<p>5. eBoox<br />
Do you like to read? The application supports the most popular e-book formats. The application provides downloading content to the reader from any phone folder and SD card, &#8220;cloud&#8221; or browsers. Also there are built-in online catalogs of books, there is an opportunity to download free publications or to purchase &#8220;LitRes&#8221; placed in the library</p>
<p>6. South Park: Phone Destroyer<br />
In this card game with familiar characters, plots and jokes, developers are proposing to become a &#8220;destroyer of mobile&#8221;. In Phone Destroyer there is a simple story component, and multiplayer. In addition, you need a permanent connection to the network. The project differs little from most card games, its main advantage is in the very franchise of South Park.</p>
<p>7. &#8220;Do not do this!&#8221;<br />
A collection of ordinary puzzle questions in an unusual wrapper. What bribes in the project is the name: after reading it, I want to know &#8211; &#8220;not to do what?&#8221;. The introductory part is also of some interest. Well, then the process goes on rolled &#8211; with earning &#8220;candy&#8221; (points), boasting about the smartest of the highly intelligent and then in a similar style.</p>
<p>8. Tanks a lot!<br />
The project managed to attract attention even before the release: the &#8220;tanks&#8221; were nominated for the best graphics award for DevGamm 2017 and for the best multiplayer at the Indie Awards 2017. At the disposal of the gamer there is a tank that can be assembled from dozens of details that affect the characteristics of the death machine &#8211; that well in one battle, will be useless in the other.</p>
<p>9. &#8220;Parallel translation of books&#8221;<br />
&#8220;English is best studied by reading English literature,&#8221; say the developers and it&#8217;s hard to argue with this statement. Often when reading foreign literature, difficulties can be caused by individual words. Then they have to guess about their translation from the context. This is also not bad, but the exact meaning of the word remains a mystery.</p>

		<title>Google Play News: App Download Preference Options</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://androidheadlines.com/category/google-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google</a> Play Store has been updated with <a href="https://androidheadlines.com/category/news/best" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">app</a> download preferences, which is definitely a nice addition if you’d like to avoid wasting your mobile data for downloading applications. When you open up Google Play Store, and head over to ‘Settings’, you should be able to see the ‘App download preference’ option. After you enter that menu, you will see three options in there:</p>
<p>‘Over any network’</p>
<p>‘Over Wi-Fi only’</p>
<p>‘Ask me every time’.</p>
<p>So for example, if you select over any network, you will be able to download applications no matter if you’re hooked up to 3G, 4G or Wi-Fi, while the ‘Over Wi-Fi only’ option will prevent you from accidentally downloading an app over mobile data.</p>
<p>If you select the ‘Over Wi-Fi only’, you can still hit the ‘Download’ button next to an app, but the phone will wait until you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network (if you’re not at the time) before it actually downloads that app. Do keep in mind that these options will not be in effect if your apps are set to update automatically in the ‘Auto-update apps’ section of Google Play Store settings, so change that accordingly.</p>
<p>This seems to be a server-side change, though it has not appeared in any version of the app before v11.1.30, so keep that mind, though this feature should be available to basically everyone who has a modern Android smartphone at this point, if not, it will be soon.</p>
<p>This new option is quite useful, and it’s rather odd that it took Google that long to implement it. That is basically it, no additional changes were spotted other than that single tweak to Google Play Store settings.</p>
