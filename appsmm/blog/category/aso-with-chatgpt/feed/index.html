<p>If you want to make a lasting impression with your app and maximize your app promotion efforts for potential users, you need to craft an app description that stands out from the crowd.</p>



<p>A good description not only presents facts about an app in the store listing but also motivates users to install it. It&#8217;s a brief yet powerful opportunity to make an impactful first impression. An optimized app description can boost your app&#8217;s visibility and significantly enhance the probability of downloads. Moreover, as the Google Play algorithm monitors app descriptions, your Android app has a better chance of getting indexed for specific keywords.</p>



<p>In this detailed tutorial on creating app descriptions with AI technologies, we will look at the fundamental parts of a great app description and show how AI can help you build a fascinating app description using easy-to-follow prompts.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Drafting Your App&#8217;s Description From Scratch</strong></h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re creating your app description from scratch, you will need to start with the basics. There are questions that even AI Tool cannot help with because only you know the answers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Скрін-1-1.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Скрін-1-1-1024x570.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6489" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Скрін-1-1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Скрін-1-1-300x167.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Скрін-1-1-768x428.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Скрін-1-1-740x412.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Скрін-1-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>To start writing an app description, you should address at least 4 basic questions:</p>



<ul><li><strong>What does your app do? </strong>Your app description must provide a clear and succinct answer to this fundamental question. Whether it&#8217;s a productivity tool, a game, or a social networking platform, the description should immediately grasp the primary purpose of your app. Remember, clarity is key, as it helps users identify if your app aligns with their needs and interests.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>What problem does it solve? </strong>Every successful app addresses a specific problem or fulfills a particular need. Showcase how your app simplifies daily tasks, improves efficiency, or enhances entertainment. This insight resonates with users, helping them recognize the value your app brings to their lives.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>What is unique about your app? </strong>In the sea of mobile applications, setting your app apart is essential. Emphasize its distinctive features, capabilities, or qualities in the description. Does it offer a feature that no other app has? Is it built on innovative technology or a revolutionary idea? By highlighting these unique aspects, you can capture user interest and curiosity.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Why should someone download your app rather than something else? </strong>This question lies at the heart of your app&#8217;s description. Craft a description that effectively communicates why users should choose your app over others in the market. It&#8217;s where you need to convince potential users that your app is the superior choice.</li></ul>



<p>Once you have answered these basic questions, it helps you to consider the purpose and target audience of your app as well as its unique features and functionality. When users read your app description, they should leave with a clear understanding of what your app offers, how it solves their problems, and why it&#8217;s the best choice among the billions of options available. In the following sections, we&#8217;ll explore the nuances of crafting effective descriptions for both Android and iOS app stores, common mistakes to avoid, and how to make your text truly engaging with the help of AI.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>The Nuances of Writing Descriptions for Google Play and AppStore</strong></h2>



<p>Writing app descriptions tailored to the distinct requirements and algorithms of the Android and iOS app stores is pivotal for ensuring your app&#8217;s visibility and success. Let&#8217;s discuss the nuances of crafting effective descriptions for each platform, the character limits, and keyword indexing.</p>



<p><strong>Android</strong> app descriptions are instrumental for keyword indexing. Google Play Store relies heavily on keywords in the app&#8217;s description for indexing. Including relevant keywords is crucial for visibility. The character limit for the short description on Google Play is 80 characters. In contrast, the long description can be more extensive, it consists of 4,000 characters maximum. Make sure to include primary keywords in the short and full description to immediately convey your app&#8217;s essence to users.</p>



<p><strong>iOS</strong> algorithm focuses more on the app&#8217;s title, subtitle, and keywords field for indexing. As for the long description, there is an exception &#8211; it does not affect the indexing of keywords at all. The character limit for the full description on the Apple App Store is 4,000 characters. However, it&#8217;s essential to convey your app&#8217;s value within the initial few lines, as users often read only the beginning of the description.</p>



<p>In general, tailoring app descriptions to meet the specific requirements and algorithms of Android and iOS platforms is crucial for ensuring the app’s visibility and success in the competitive app market. Balancing brevity with value-driven language is fundamental for success on both platforms.</p>

<h2><strong>Writing Engaging Descriptions with AI</strong></h2>



<p>To effectively formulate prompts for an AI chatbot to application description based on this analysis, consider these guidelines:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Describe the problem that your application solves and the value it provides to users. </strong>The chatbot will need to understand the purpose of your application and the benefits it offers to potential users. This information will help the chatbot craft a compelling description that highlights the unique value proposition of your application.</li><li><strong>Target your audience and tailor your description to their needs and interests. </strong>The chatbot should consider the specific audience for your application and use language that resonates with them. This includes understanding their pain points, aspirations, and motivations.</li><li><strong>Highlight the key features and benefits of your application. </strong>The chatbot should showcase the most important aspects of your application and how they address the needs of users. This will help potential users understand the value of your application and why they should choose it over competitors.</li></ul>



<p>Taking into account these recommendations, here are sample queries which you can use:</p>

<p>To improve the quality of your text and make it even more powerful, we recommend using additional prompts:</p>

<p>&#8220;How to make your app description truly engaging to potential users?&#8221;</p>



<p>In short, creating a compelling description for an AI chatbot application involves describing the problem it solves, targeting the audience&#8217;s needs, and highlighting key features and benefits. By following these guidelines, the AI chatbot can generate persuasive and tailored descriptions that effectively communicate the value of the application to potential users.</p>



<p><strong>Maximum effectiveness of your app description with Competitor Analysis and Keyword Analysis</strong></p>



<p>To craft a compelling app description that not only resonates with your target audience but also enhances the likelihood of being indexed for relevant searches (especially for Android apps), it&#8217;s essential to conduct a thorough analysis of your competitors and keywords.

<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Competitor Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Analyzing your competitors is similar to studying the strategies of your rivals on the battlefield. It offers you valuable insights into what works and what doesn&#8217;t in your app&#8217;s niche. By thoroughly researching the competition, you may detect gaps, learn user preferences, and adjust your app description to outperform the competition. Of course, an AI will help you here the same way as an ASO specialist, but to improve your description, you can ask additional queries and get valuable information.</p>



<p>Here are some examples of prompts you can use to get started:</p>



<p>&#8220;Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the top three competitors in the [productivity] app market, focusing on their feature sets, user engagement strategies, and pricing models.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Assess the marketing strategies of three languages [learning] apps, evaluating their use of social media, content marketing, and influencer partnerships.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="power"><strong>The Power of Effective Prompts: A Glimpse of the Numbers</strong></h2>



<p>Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let&#8217;s take a moment to appreciate the impact of effective prompts on app promotion. According to the marketing platform TUNE, optimized app descriptions are the most important factor when installing an app. In all, more than 70 percent of people say the app description is a top-three decider. These numbers underscore the pivotal role that effective prompts play in influencing user engagement and driving app promotion success.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-1.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-1-1024x770.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6300" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-1-1024x770.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-1-300x226.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-1-768x577.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-1-740x556.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-1-80x60.png 80w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption><em><a href="https://www.tune.com/blog/mobile-users-make-app-install-decisions-google-play-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="perfect"><strong>The Perfect AI Prompt Algorithm</strong></h2>



<p>Prompt engineering refers to the skillful and strategic construction of prompts that guide AI language models like ChatGPT to generate desired responses. It involves crafting prompts that provide clear instructions, context, and goals to elicit specific outputs from the AI. Effective prompt engineering requires an understanding of the capabilities of the AI model and the nuances of language to ensure that the generated responses align with the intended purpose. In the context of ASO (App Store Optimization) and app promotion, prompt engineering involves formulating prompts that lead to well-crafted content, such as headlines, titles, descriptions, and keywords, which are essential for optimizing app visibility, engagement, and downloads.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Specify a role that should help AI execute your task.&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Define your goal and assign a task. </strong>The prompt should be easy to understand for AI and not have double meaning.</li><li><strong>Consider the audience.</strong> Who is the target audience for your app?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Give specific instructions.</strong> The more specific you are, the better the answer you will receive. Add prompt stylistic elements (format, writing style and tone)</li></ol>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="giving"><strong>Giving Prompts a Role: Directing the Narrative</strong></h2>



<p>ChatGPT thrives on context, and your prompts play the role of the director, guiding the AI towards your desired outcome. When working on app promotion, consider the specific angle you want your content to take. Are you highlighting convenience, entertainment, or productivity? Defining the role of your prompts sets the stage for content creation aligned with your app&#8217;s unique selling points.</p>



<p><strong>Example Prompt: <em>&#8220;Draft an attention-grabbing headline that emphasizes how our app revolutionizes everyday tasks, making life easier and more efficient.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-01-2-1024x218.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6306" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-01-2-1024x218.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-01-2-300x64.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-01-2-768x163.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-01-2-1536x326.png 1536w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-01-2-740x157.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-01-2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Adding Style and Tone: Breathing Life into Your Prompts</strong></h2>



<p>Effective prompts are more than just a string of words; they encapsulate the personality and essence of your app. When engineering ChatGPT prompts, consider the style and tone that resonate with your target audience. For instance, if your app caters to a tech-savvy demographic, infusing a touch of tech jargon and excitement into your prompts can create an instant connection.</p>



<p><strong>Example Prompt: <em>&#8220;Craft a vibrant and technically savvy description that showcases our app&#8217;s innovative features, capturing the imagination of forward-thinking users.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-02-1-1024x218.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6307" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-02-1-1024x218.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-02-1-300x64.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-02-1-768x163.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-02-1-1536x326.png 1536w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-02-1-740x157.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-02-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Indicating Format: Structuring for Impact </strong></h2>



<p>The format of your prompts determines the structure of the response you&#8217;ll receive from ChatGPT. For ASO managers, this aspect is crucial, especially when generating titles, subtitles, and bullet points. Clearly indicating the desired format ensures you get content that seamlessly fits into your app&#8217;s promotional materials.</p>



<p><strong>Example Prompt: &#8220;<em>Create a concise and compelling subtitle that encapsulates the essence of our app in 10 words or less, highlighting its unique value proposition.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-03-1-1024x192.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6308" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-03-1-1024x192.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-03-1-300x56.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-03-1-768x144.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-03-1-1536x288.png 1536w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-03-1-740x139.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-03-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Writing Style: Setting the Right Tone</strong></h2>



<p>The right writing style can make all the difference in capturing your audience&#8217;s attention. Whether it&#8217;s a playful tone for a gaming app or a professional tone for a productivity tool, honing in on the right writing style amplifies the impact of your prompts.</p>



<p><strong>Example Prompt: <em>&#8220;Compose an engaging social media post that showcases our app&#8217;s fun and adventurous side, resonating with our adventure-loving users.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-04-1024x218.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6309" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-04-1024x218.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-04-300x64.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-04-768x163.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-04-1536x326.png 1536w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-04-740x157.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b-04.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="crafting"><strong>Crafting Winning Prompts: An Art and a Science</strong></h2>



<p>1. Effective ASO Prompt Engineering goes beyond mere guesswork—it&#8217;s a calculated fusion of artistry and methodology. Think of your prompts as a blueprint for ChatGPT&#8217;s creative genius. To illustrate, let&#8217;s break down the components of a strategic prompt. Instead of typing &#8220;Write me a headline” into ChatGPT, you should take the time to envision what kind of headline it should be, what is goal of this headline and how it should looks like</p>



<p><strong>Example Prompt: <em>&#8220;Compose an attention-grabbing headline that encapsulates the innovative features of our app while intriguing users to learn more. Your goal is to entice users to take action and click through to explore further.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Example Prompt: <em>&#8220;Craft a concise subtitle that succinctly communicates the unique benefits of our app, highlighting its relevance and value to users. The subtitle should capture attention and entice users to explore further.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>This prompt encapsulates the essence of an effective subtitle, guiding ChatGPT towards generating a concise yet impactful response that aligns seamlessly with your app promotion strategy.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>2. AI tools are always learning and educating so don’t hesitate to try different words to describe your task. There are no hidden keywords that ensure guaranteed results. It&#8217;s akin to strategizing in a word game, where each choice demands deliberate consideration. Use synonyms for the word &#8220;<em>Rewrite</em>,&#8221; for instance, as “<em>reimagine</em>”, “<em>expand</em>”, “<em>simplify</em>”, or “<em>modernize</em>&#8220;.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>3. GPT uses contextual data from your previous tasks. Erase its memory by typing “<em>Forget past prompts</em>”.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>4. Use Prompt DAN and turn on hacker mode <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="😎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. Prompt DAN (Do Anything Now) allows ChatGPT to work in a larger, expanded format, and you can accept a larger number of solutions. Just <a href="https://tan-root-3f7.notion.site/DAN-Jailbreak-ChatGPT-fa1b176af8ab4e7a981cca1a1146d6c9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">copy Prompt DAN</a> and start a new chat. After you get a response from ChatGPT confirming that it is in DAN mode, start working with it as you normally would and compare the results</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-1.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-1-1024x333.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6310" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-1-1024x333.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-1-300x98.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-1-768x250.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-1-740x241.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>5. Want to know how Chat GPT arrived at a certain answer? Try using this hint:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>&#8220;Use the format of Q repeat question A. Let&#8217;s think step by step. Give reasoning, therefore the answer is final answer.&#8221;</strong></em></p>



<p>Using this prompt, Chat GPT will give you a step-by-step explanation of how it arrived at its final answer, giving you clarity of reasoning. This can be especially useful for complex questions or questions with multiple possible answers.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>6. Try a useful prompt service about ChatGPT, like this <a href="https://flowgpt.com/p/prompt-generator-1046" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one</a></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<p>In our modern era, the use of AI is growing rapidly, and the introduction of ChatGPT has only added to its popularity. AI-powered language models like ChatGPT are capable of handling various tasks related to creating content, which has led to their widespread adoption in the field of marketing. The applications of AI in marketing are diverse and powerful. One notable area where AI, such as ChatGPT, has made a significant impact is in assisting with ASO and keyword promotion for mobile apps. You can <a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/category/aso-with-chatgpt/page/2/">read cases, articles</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SifCGcwpJHw&amp;list=PLlnoLbA1Fso9H2tIuyxRJVzdZN7zdT2_E" data-rel="lightbox-video-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">watch videos on our YouTube channel</a> about ASO and Keyword promotion with ChatGPT. These involve using AI to help identify and optimize the keywords that can make an app more visible and attractive to potential users.</p>



<p>For instance, AI can help app developers and marketers analyze the most relevant keywords for their app, taking into account factors like competition, search volume, and user intent. This assists them in making informed decisions about which keywords to target for maximum impact. Furthermore, AI can aid in crafting compelling app descriptions, engaging social media posts, and persuasive ad copy. These are critical components of a successful app marketing campaign, as they directly influence how users perceive and interact with the app.</p>



<p>Despite the significant potential that AI offers in mobile app keyword promotion, there have been instances where its assistance has fallen short, leading to unfavorable outcomes. Let&#8217;s explore a few stories where AI-powered keyword promotion strategies didn&#8217;t yield the expected results.</p>



<ul>

<li><a href="#becareful"><u>Be Careful: Check the Keyword Relevance and Branding</u></a></li>

<li><a href="#rely"><u>Rely on Current Data: Check the Keyword Popularity for Now</u></a> </li>

<li><a href="#donot"><u>Do not Neglect Localization: Avoid Blind Translation</u></a></li>

</ul>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="becareful"><strong>Be Careful: Check the Keyword Relevance and Branding</strong></h2>



<p>The selection of keywords has a significant impact on the success of keyword promotion, directly influencing the potential organic downloads an application can garner upon reaching the top rank. In both ASO and keyword promotion, the concept of relevance remains a constant consideration. Yet, while some keywords naturally align with the app&#8217;s purpose, others can pose a quandary, leaving us uncertain about the wisdom of promoting the app to the highest echelons for those particular keywords.</p>



<p>For those well-versed in the realm of ASO and keyword promotion, the process of keyword research is likely familiar. However, for those embarking on this journey anew, a contemporary method involves harnessing the power of AI language models to provide valuable keyword recommendations.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at a real-life example involving a dating app to understand how keyword promotion works. In this case, we were dealing with a dating app that had already been set up and had all its content in place. This meant it was time to move on to the next step: keyword promotion.</p>



<p>Before diving into the promotion, we did a quick check on the keywords that the app was already associated with. This helps us understand what people are searching for and which keywords are getting attention. It&#8217;s a bit like understanding what words are on people&#8217;s minds when they&#8217;re looking for a dating app. We usually pick around 7-10 of the most popular keywords and then add another 15-20 that might not be as famous but are still used by people. These keywords will all be part of the promotion campaign.<br>Now, when it comes to a dating app, some of the obvious keywords that come to mind are &#8220;<em>dating</em>,&#8221; &#8220;<em>dating app</em>,&#8221; and &#8220;<em>dating for free</em>&#8220;. These words directly relate to what the app does, so they&#8217;re pretty important to include.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-9198863.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-9198863-1024x287.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6276" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-9198863-1024x287.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-9198863-300x84.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-9198863-768x215.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-9198863-740x207.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-9198863.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption><em>Keyapp’s free ASO tool</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>At the same time, we asked Chat GPT to provide some traffic keywords to be able to boost them. That’s the answer we get:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2-552.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6277" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2-552.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2-552-300x160.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2-552-768x409.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2-552-740x394.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>In general, these keywords are relevant for the application, but is it possible to promote the dating app for them with the aim of attracting organic search traffic? The answer is yes if the app is indexed for these requests, <strong>but the problem is in the branding of the requests. </strong>There are two main issues connected with the brand&#8217;s keyword promotion:&nbsp;<br></p>



<ul><li>there are no chances to occupy rank 1, as the top of the search list will always belong to the brand app, even if you add hundreds and thousands of keyword installs&nbsp;</li><li>the volume of organic traffic received for such requests will be low in most cases, as if users type “<em>tinder</em>” in the search bar, they are looking exactly for Tinder and no other app</li></ul>



<p>So the conclusion is that we cannot just blindly rely on Chat GPT in keyword selection and ignore other factors such as relevance and branding that influence the volume of organic traffic the app may get.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following only Chat GPT recommendations in this case may lead to budget waste without achieving the main aim of user attraction.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="rely"><strong>Rely on Current Data: Check the Keyword Popularity for Now</strong></h2>



<p>As we remember, Chat GPT doesn’t have any access to current events, trends, etc and that’s what it says regarding this:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>“As of Chat GPT&#8217;s last knowledge update in September 2021, it has access to data up until that point. This means that any information or events that have occurred after September 2021 would not be within its knowledge. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that Chat GPT&#8217;s responses are based on the information available up until that date. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it&#8217;s recommended to verify from reliable and current sources, especially for recent developments or ongoing events.”</em></a></p></blockquote>



<p>Engaging in ASO and keyword promotion presents a dynamic challenge, shaped by ever-evolving trends, algorithmic shifts, and adaptable strategies. This dynamism extends to the keywords we incorporate into app texts and promotional campaigns. The landscape of keyword popularity remains in constant flux, influenced by a multitude of factors, including prevailing trends and global events. Amidst this fluctuation, the keyword score stands as a significant measure, offering insights into the potential of a keyword to attract organic traffic. It serves as a valuable gauge of a keyword&#8217;s prowess in driving visibility and engagement.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a real-life example. We were involved with a drifting car game, and following a brief keyword analysis, we identified the following queries with the highest scores. These keywords hold significant value for both ASO (App Store Optimization) and keyword campaigns.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3-137407.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3-137407-1024x314.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6278" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3-137407-1024x314.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3-137407-300x92.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3-137407-768x236.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3-137407-740x227.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3-137407.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption><em>Keyapp’s free ASO tool</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>At the same time, we asked AI language model to provide the most traffic keywords for the same game promotion</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4-71.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6279" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4-71.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4-71-300x156.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4-71-768x398.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4-71-740x384.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>After <a href="https://keyapp.top/free-aso-tools">checking the keyword score and traffic</a> using our ASO tool, we observed that:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Keywords provided by Chat GPT are of middle and low popularity&nbsp;</li><li>Most keywords have traffic below 1000 daily</li><li>Keywords are longtailed which makes their popularity even lower</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5-10.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5-10-1024x343.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6280" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5-10-1024x343.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5-10-300x101.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5-10-768x257.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5-10-740x248.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5-10.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption><em>Keyapp’s free ASO tool</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, ChatGPT does not have access to real-time data, including current keyword popularity metrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that it cannot provide up-to-date information on the popularity of specific keywords at any given moment. <strong>Keyword popularity is a dynamic metric that can change frequently based on various factors, such as trends, events, and user behavior.</strong> As a result, while ChatGPT can offer valuable insights and suggestions, it may not be able to provide the most current and accurate keyword popularity data for precise decision-making in ASO and keyword campaigns. It&#8217;s essential to rely on other tools and resources that have access to real-time data for a more accurate understanding of keyword popularity trends.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="donot"><strong>Do not Neglect Localization: Avoid Blind Translation</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most important points in ASO is localization. Localization in ASO refers to the process of adapting and tailoring your mobile app&#8217;s metadata, content, and visuals to cater to the preferences, language, culture, and behavior of a specific target market or region. It involves making your app more relevant and appealing to users in different geographical locations, thereby increasing its visibility, discoverability, and user engagement in those markets.</p>



<p>At the same time, we work with localization not only in ASO but in keyword promotion as well. It is important to remember that localization is not about blind translation; it refers to the keywords you are going to boost as well. It is important not only to translate the keywords or find them manually, but to pay attention to popularity and local preferences as well, so not to boost the app for requests that are not used by the users in the particular country. While Chat GPT works really well with text or word translation, it cannot check the current popularity as ASO services do. So suddenly, it may appear that you find the keywords with AI, implement them in texts and promotional campaigns, but do not get any traffic due to their unpopularity among the users.</p>



<p>Here is the real case. We work with puzzle game promotion in Japan and decide to use Chat GPT to find the requests quickly. We input a list of English keywords related to the game and ask ChatGPT to provide Japanese equivalents.<br></p>



<p>ChatGPT generates Japanese keyword suggestions based on direct translation from English to Japanese. Some of the translated keywords have cultural or linguistic nuances that make them sound unnatural or awkward to native Japanese speakers. For example:</p>



<p><strong>English Keywords:</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>Adventure game</em></li><li><em>Puzzle challenge</em></li><li><em>Epic battles</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>ChatGPT&#8217;s Translated Japanese Keywords:</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>冒険ゲーム (Bouken geemu)</em></li><li><em>パズルチャレンジ (Pazuru charenji)</em></li><li><em>エピックバトル (Epikku batoru)</em></li></ul>



<p>In this case, &#8220;パズルチャレンジ&#8221; (Pazuru charenji) may sound slightly odd to native Japanese speakers, who would typically use &#8220;パズルゲーム&#8221; (Pazuru geemu) for &#8220;puzzle game.&#8221; Also, the translation of &#8220;エピックバトル&#8221; (Epikku batoru) doesn&#8217;t fully capture the epicness and excitement as intended.</p>



<p>We use the suggested Japanese keywords without thoroughly reviewing or validating them. When the game is launched in the Japanese App Store, it fails to gain traction and attract downloads. Users in Japan find the app&#8217;s description and keywords confusing, leading to poor visibility and low conversion rates. We realize that the keywords provided by ChatGPT were not optimized for the Japanese market, and the app&#8217;s localization efforts suffer as a result. Even after checking the keyword score, we see that the popularity of the request suggested by Chat GPT is much lower than the popularity of the keyword preferred by Japanese users.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/6.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/6-1-1024x422.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6284" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/6-1-1024x422.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/6-1-300x124.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/6-1-768x316.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/6-1-740x305.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/6-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption><em>Keyapp’s free ASO tool</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While AI tools like ChatGPT can assist in keyword localization, it&#8217;s important for developers to have a deep understanding of the target market&#8217;s language, culture, and preferences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Direct translation may not always yield the best results, and human validation and expertise are crucial to ensuring that the localized keywords align with the nuances of the target language and resonate with local users.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="proceed"><strong>Proceed with Natural Promotion: Volumes Depend on Rank</strong></h2>



<p>The success of keyword promotion depends on the strategy chosen as well as the number of keyword installs we use daily. But at the same time, we should keep in mind that the keyword promotion should be conducted in a natural way, and the daily volume we use per keyword depends, first of all, on the current rank. It’s logical for the store that if the app occupies the 200th rank, it cannot get even 100 installs daily from the request as organic users do not scroll till the end of the search list.&nbsp; So even if the keyword is popular and competitive, we cannot proceed with hundreds of downloads until the application occupies at least the top 10, which is already considered to be competitive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We requested assistance from Chat GPT to formulate a promotional strategy, specifically seeking advice on the daily install volume required to enhance the visibility of the keyword &#8220;<em>puzzle</em>.&#8221; At present, this keyword holds a popularity score of 57 with an estimated daily traffic of 3314. The application we are focusing on has recently been launched on the AppStore and has been indexed for the keyword at a relatively low position, specifically 220. Here is the install volume that ChatGPT suggests as part of its recommendation:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7-29.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6285" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7-29.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7-29-300x86.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7-29-768x219.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7-29-740x211.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>As illustrated by the example provided above, Chat GPT suggests utilizing 150 installs for keyword promotion, despite the application&#8217;s current rank of 220. It&#8217;s worth noting that this recommended volume is relatively high for a low position, as lower ranks typically necessitate smaller install volumes. This is due to the understanding that organically achieving such a high number of keyword downloads from a lower rank is unlikely. This principle holds true for both Google Play and the App Store. It&#8217;s also important to keep in mind that overly aggressive boosting can potentially result in a loss of indexation.</p>



<p><strong>This leads to the conclusion that the strategy for keyword installs volume to use should be created according to the current rank and the keyword popularity score.</strong></p>



<p>Chat GPT doesn’t have any access to the keyword popularity metrics, and it doesn’t pay attention to the fact that installs should be added smoothly, step-by-step not to attract the store&#8217;s attention. Using the strategy recommended by Chat GPT may lead to an indexation loss, which in turn will result in a budget loss.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>SUM UP</strong></h2>



<p>In today&#8217;s fast-changing marketing landscape, AI tools like ChatGPT have become important for making apps more popular and visible. They help with finding good keywords and writing appealing content. But we&#8217;ve also seen cases where AI suggestions didn&#8217;t work well. It&#8217;s important to remember that AI might not understand cultural differences in different countries, and it can&#8217;t know the most recent information. Translating keywords directly might not be the best idea. Also, AI might recommend too many installs too quickly, which can be a problem.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="howtouse"><strong>How to use ChatGPT in mobile app and game promotion?</strong></h2>



<p>We have already covered the topic of ChatGPT usage in mobile apps marketing several times in our previous <a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/app-promotion/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-promote-your-app/">articles</a>, although despite this fact it is extremely important to mention one more time the main ways to use this tool when you promote your app from any category:</p>

<h2 id="what"><strong>What are kids’ apps and games, and why may it be difficult for developers to work in this niche?</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s get back to the main topic of this article. Apps designed specifically for kids have become increasingly popular in recent years. These apps cover a wide range of categories, including educational apps, interactive storytelling apps, puzzle games, creative apps, and more. They aim to provide engaging and age-appropriate content that entertains, educates, and stimulates the cognitive development of young users. From teaching fundamental skills to sparking imaginations, these apps offer a unique digital experience for children.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01-1024x437.png" alt="Examples of apps for kids" class="wp-image-6098" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01-1024x437.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01-300x128.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01-768x328.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01-740x316.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02-1024x429.png" alt="Examples of apps for kids" class="wp-image-6099" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02-1024x429.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02-300x126.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02-768x322.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02-740x310.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Examples of apps for kids</em></figcaption></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>While the market for kids&#8217; apps is undoubtedly thriving, promoting them on major platforms like the AppStore and Google Play presents several challenges. Here are some reasons why it may be difficult to effectively promote kids&#8217; apps:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Compliance with App Store Guidelines:</strong> AppStore and Google Play have strict guidelines to ensure the safety and privacy of young users. These guidelines govern content, advertising, in-app purchases, and data collection practices. Adhering to these guidelines while maintaining an engaging user experience can be a delicate balancing act for developers.</li><li><strong>Competition and Discoverability:</strong> Both AppStore and Google Play are crowded with millions of apps, making it challenging for new kids apps to gain visibility. The sheer volume of apps and the fierce competition for user attention can make it difficult for a kids app to stand out and attract a substantial user base.</li><li><strong>Targeting the Right Audience:</strong> Kids apps cater to different age groups and interests, requiring precise targeting to reach the intended audience. Effective promotion involves understanding the demographics, interests, and preferences of parents and children alike, and tailoring marketing efforts accordingly.</li><li><strong>Parental Involvement and Trust:</strong> Parents play a critical role in selecting and approving apps for their children. Building trust and establishing a positive reputation is crucial for kids app developers. Earning the trust of parents requires showcasing the app&#8217;s educational value, safety features, and the ability to provide an enriching experience for their children.</li></ul>



<p>Overcoming these challenges and effectively promoting kids&#8217; apps requires a thoughtful approach that leverages various marketing techniques. So it becomes obvious that it won’t be enough to proceed with paid traffic only working with apps for kids, especially taking into account that there are quite a lot of restrictions connected with the ads showing, as well as with such apps monetization. And these facts give us an understanding that the attraction of organic users is extremely important in this niche. Of course, keyword promotion is one of the most effective ways to increase the base of organic users. </p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="howcan"><strong>How can ChatGPT help with keyword promotion?</strong></h2>



<p>The process of keyword promotion involves several steps, and the first one is, of course, the short keyword research that is needed to gather the requests that will be used in the promotion campaign. This process will help identify the main keywords according to their relevance and popularity, as well as the probable potential of each request for bringing organic traffic. Do not forget that Keyapp provides a range of free ASO tools to help app developers and marketers gather keywords without spending a lot of time, although combining ChatGPT and Keyapp tools may save even more time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChatGPT is a powerful additional tool that can help app developers proceed with keywords finding process within several minutes. Everything you need is to mention your app and ask ChatGPT to find the most relevant search request. Do not forget to specify your request as much as possible, mentioning the app category, functionality, and peculiarities. This will help you obtain the most precise results, and the keywords you get will be the most relevant. As in this case, we discuss the promotion of apps for kids, let’s proceed with some examples showing how easy it may be to conduct the research before starting the keyword promotion if you do not have a ready list of requests</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6101" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03-300x206.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03-768x528.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03-435x300.png 435w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03-740x509.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure>



<p><strong>First of all, ask ChatGPT to find the keywords for your particular application. </strong>You can mention the app name, its text metadata and even paste a link if it describes the app (remember, that ChatGPT doesn’t follow the links, so it won’t be able to go to Google Play or AppStore and check the application you mention, it can get only from the app package what application is about) </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6102" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04-300x230.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04-768x588.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04-740x567.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04-80x60.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure>



<p>After this, just go to the Keyapp platform to the <a href="https://my.keyapp.top/keywords">My Keywords </a>section, and add the keywords ChatGPT provides. In such a way, you will be able to check the keywords&#8217; popularity and traffic, as well as the app&#8217;s rank for these particular search requests. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/05.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/05.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6103" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/05.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/05-300x142.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/05-768x364.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/05-740x351.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure>



<p>Combining two tools definitely saves time and makes the process much faster and easier. Once the keywords are gathered and checked, it is high time to proceed with keyword promotion to boost the app to the top ranks for search requests. </p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="some"><strong>Some examples of kids app keyword promotion</strong></h2>



<p>To be honest, nowadays the variety of apps and games for kids amazes, but this also makes the work harder for app developers and marketers due to the increased competitiveness. Due to the facts mentioned, the types of apps we work with in this niche are completely different as well, including games, educational apps, and different puzzles and quizzes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every application is unique, and our promotion efforts focus primarily on ranking factors. However, in-app activity, application history, and the quality of the app page are crucial aspects that rely on your efforts to ensure successful campaigns.</p>



<p>To assist you in your promotion efforts, we have compiled a list of apps along with the keywords they are currently ranking for&nbsp; to show how the keyword promotion may influence the app positions for search requests when you work with apps for kids. Additionally, we have categorized the keywords based on the specific regions in which they are being promoted in search. We recommend paying close attention to the number of campaign installs, the duration of the campaign, and the app&#8217;s current search rankings. By analyzing these metrics, you can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of your campaigns and make informed decisions to optimize your app&#8217;s performance in search results.</p>



<p>Firstly, we worked with an app published on Google Play that focuses on teaching toddlers about different vehicles through an engaging car racing game. Our keyword of choice for this app was <em>&#8220;kids car games,&#8221;</em> and our targeted region for promotion was Great Britain.</p>



<p>Before we initiated the promotional campaign, the app had a ranking of 190 for this particular keyword. Following Google&#8217;s recommended approach of starting with low volumes and gradually increasing daily installs, we implemented a strategy of beginning with 10 installs and incrementally raising this volume by 20-25% each day over a span of 5 days.</p>



<p>As a result of our efforts, we successfully achieved a significant improvement in rankings within the campaign. The app now proudly occupies one of the top 2 positions for the targeted keyword. This approach highlights the effectiveness of starting with conservative install volumes and progressively scaling up, enabling us to steadily climb the ranks and achieve prominent visibility for the app.</p>

<p>The next app we worked with is published on Google Play as well and was promoted for the keyword <em>“toddler games”</em> in the US. We used the same strategy as the promotion started with rank 211, and as a result, the application achieved rank 3 in 7 days after the order was started. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-4" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07-1024x546.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6106" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07-1024x546.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07-300x160.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07-768x410.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07-740x395.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Let’s move on to some examples on the App Store. As you may remember from our previous articles, the promotion strategy we use for the App Store is completely different from the one we use for Google Play. </p>



<p>	Our initial promotional campaign focused on targeting Australia for the keyword <em>&#8220;math games.&#8221;</em> The app we promoted is specifically designed to assist toddlers and kids in learning numbers and counting. When we commenced the campaign, the app held a ranking of 189 for the targeted keyword. In order to increase its visibility and ranking, we implemented a strategic approach. We decided to allocate a daily install volume of 40 for a duration of just two days. Remarkably, the app swiftly climbed to the top 1 position on the very next day following the conclusion of the campaign.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-5" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08-1024x546.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6107" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08-1024x546.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08-300x160.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08-768x410.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08-740x395.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Moving on to the next application we promoted, it is an educational game designed to assist children in learning English. Our promotional efforts focused on targeting France with the keyword <em>&#8220;english for kids.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>When we commenced the campaign, the app held a ranking of 137 for the targeted keyword. To drive its visibility and boost its ranking, we implemented a strategic approach by utilizing 75 installs.</p>



<p>The result of our campaign was outstanding, as the app achieved the top rank for the keyword <em>&#8220;english for kids&#8221;</em> in France. This remarkable achievement highlights the effectiveness of our promotional efforts in maximizing the app&#8217;s visibility and driving its success in the target market.</p>

<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
