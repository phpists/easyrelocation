<h2 id="what"><strong>What are kids’ apps and games, and why may it be difficult for developers to work in this niche?</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s get back to the main topic of this article. Apps designed specifically for kids have become increasingly popular in recent years. These apps cover a wide range of categories, including educational apps, interactive storytelling apps, puzzle games, creative apps, and more. They aim to provide engaging and age-appropriate content that entertains, educates, and stimulates the cognitive development of young users. From teaching fundamental skills to sparking imaginations, these apps offer a unique digital experience for children.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01-1024x437.png" alt="Examples of apps for kids" class="wp-image-6098" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01-1024x437.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01-300x128.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01-768x328.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01-740x316.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02-1024x429.png" alt="Examples of apps for kids" class="wp-image-6099" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02-1024x429.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02-300x126.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02-768x322.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02-740x310.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Examples of apps for kids</em></figcaption></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>While the market for kids&#8217; apps is undoubtedly thriving, promoting them on major platforms like the AppStore and Google Play presents several challenges. Here are some reasons why it may be difficult to effectively promote kids&#8217; apps:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Compliance with App Store Guidelines:</strong> AppStore and Google Play have strict guidelines to ensure the safety and privacy of young users. These guidelines govern content, advertising, in-app purchases, and data collection practices. Adhering to these guidelines while maintaining an engaging user experience can be a delicate balancing act for developers.</li><li><strong>Competition and Discoverability:</strong> Both AppStore and Google Play are crowded with millions of apps, making it challenging for new kids apps to gain visibility. The sheer volume of apps and the fierce competition for user attention can make it difficult for a kids app to stand out and attract a substantial user base.</li><li><strong>Targeting the Right Audience:</strong> Kids apps cater to different age groups and interests, requiring precise targeting to reach the intended audience. Effective promotion involves understanding the demographics, interests, and preferences of parents and children alike, and tailoring marketing efforts accordingly.</li><li><strong>Parental Involvement and Trust:</strong> Parents play a critical role in selecting and approving apps for their children. Building trust and establishing a positive reputation is crucial for kids app developers. Earning the trust of parents requires showcasing the app&#8217;s educational value, safety features, and the ability to provide an enriching experience for their children.</li></ul>



<p>Overcoming these challenges and effectively promoting kids&#8217; apps requires a thoughtful approach that leverages various marketing techniques. So it becomes obvious that it won’t be enough to proceed with paid traffic only working with apps for kids, especially taking into account that there are quite a lot of restrictions connected with the ads showing, as well as with such apps monetization. And these facts give us an understanding that the attraction of organic users is extremely important in this niche. Of course, keyword promotion is one of the most effective ways to increase the base of organic users. </p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="howcan"><strong>How can ChatGPT help with keyword promotion?</strong></h2>



<p>The process of keyword promotion involves several steps, and the first one is, of course, the short keyword research that is needed to gather the requests that will be used in the promotion campaign. This process will help identify the main keywords according to their relevance and popularity, as well as the probable potential of each request for bringing organic traffic. Do not forget that Keyapp provides a range of free ASO tools to help app developers and marketers gather keywords without spending a lot of time, although combining ChatGPT and Keyapp tools may save even more time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChatGPT is a powerful additional tool that can help app developers proceed with keywords finding process within several minutes. Everything you need is to mention your app and ask ChatGPT to find the most relevant search request. Do not forget to specify your request as much as possible, mentioning the app category, functionality, and peculiarities. This will help you obtain the most precise results, and the keywords you get will be the most relevant. As in this case, we discuss the promotion of apps for kids, let’s proceed with some examples showing how easy it may be to conduct the research before starting the keyword promotion if you do not have a ready list of requests</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6101" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03-300x206.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03-768x528.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03-435x300.png 435w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03-740x509.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure>



<p><strong>First of all, ask ChatGPT to find the keywords for your particular application. </strong>You can mention the app name, its text metadata and even paste a link if it describes the app (remember, that ChatGPT doesn’t follow the links, so it won’t be able to go to Google Play or AppStore and check the application you mention, it can get only from the app package what application is about) </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6102" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04-300x230.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04-768x588.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04-740x567.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04-80x60.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure>



<p>After this, just go to the Keyapp platform to the <a href="https://my.keyapp.top/keywords">My Keywords </a>section, and add the keywords ChatGPT provides. In such a way, you will be able to check the keywords&#8217; popularity and traffic, as well as the app&#8217;s rank for these particular search requests. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/05.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/05.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6103" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/05.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/05-300x142.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/05-768x364.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/05-740x351.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure>



<p>Combining two tools definitely saves time and makes the process much faster and easier. Once the keywords are gathered and checked, it is high time to proceed with keyword promotion to boost the app to the top ranks for search requests. </p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="some"><strong>Some examples of kids app keyword promotion</strong></h2>



<p>To be honest, nowadays the variety of apps and games for kids amazes, but this also makes the work harder for app developers and marketers due to the increased competitiveness. Due to the facts mentioned, the types of apps we work with in this niche are completely different as well, including games, educational apps, and different puzzles and quizzes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every application is unique, and our promotion efforts focus primarily on ranking factors. However, in-app activity, application history, and the quality of the app page are crucial aspects that rely on your efforts to ensure successful campaigns.</p>



<p>To assist you in your promotion efforts, we have compiled a list of apps along with the keywords they are currently ranking for&nbsp; to show how the keyword promotion may influence the app positions for search requests when you work with apps for kids. Additionally, we have categorized the keywords based on the specific regions in which they are being promoted in search. We recommend paying close attention to the number of campaign installs, the duration of the campaign, and the app&#8217;s current search rankings. By analyzing these metrics, you can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of your campaigns and make informed decisions to optimize your app&#8217;s performance in search results.</p>



<p>Firstly, we worked with an app published on Google Play that focuses on teaching toddlers about different vehicles through an engaging car racing game. Our keyword of choice for this app was <em>&#8220;kids car games,&#8221;</em> and our targeted region for promotion was Great Britain.</p>



<p>Before we initiated the promotional campaign, the app had a ranking of 190 for this particular keyword. Following Google&#8217;s recommended approach of starting with low volumes and gradually increasing daily installs, we implemented a strategy of beginning with 10 installs and incrementally raising this volume by 20-25% each day over a span of 5 days.</p>



<p>As a result of our efforts, we successfully achieved a significant improvement in rankings within the campaign. The app now proudly occupies one of the top 2 positions for the targeted keyword. This approach highlights the effectiveness of starting with conservative install volumes and progressively scaling up, enabling us to steadily climb the ranks and achieve prominent visibility for the app.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06-1024x546.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6105" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06-1024x546.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06-300x160.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06-768x410.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06-740x395.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>The next app we worked with is published on Google Play as well and was promoted for the keyword <em>“toddler games”</em> in the US. We used the same strategy as the promotion started with rank 211, and as a result, the application achieved rank 3 in 7 days after the order was started. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-4" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07-1024x546.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6106" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07-1024x546.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07-300x160.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07-768x410.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07-740x395.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Let’s move on to some examples on the App Store. As you may remember from our previous articles, the promotion strategy we use for the App Store is completely different from the one we use for Google Play. </p>



<p>	Our initial promotional campaign focused on targeting Australia for the keyword <em>&#8220;math games.&#8221;</em> The app we promoted is specifically designed to assist toddlers and kids in learning numbers and counting. When we commenced the campaign, the app held a ranking of 189 for the targeted keyword. In order to increase its visibility and ranking, we implemented a strategic approach. We decided to allocate a daily install volume of 40 for a duration of just two days. Remarkably, the app swiftly climbed to the top 1 position on the very next day following the conclusion of the campaign.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-5" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08-1024x546.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6107" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08-1024x546.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08-300x160.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08-768x410.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08-740x395.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Moving on to the next application we promoted, it is an educational game designed to assist children in learning English. Our promotional efforts focused on targeting France with the keyword <em>&#8220;english for kids.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>When we commenced the campaign, the app held a ranking of 137 for the targeted keyword. To drive its visibility and boost its ranking, we implemented a strategic approach by utilizing 75 installs.</p>



<p>The result of our campaign was outstanding, as the app achieved the top rank for the keyword <em>&#8220;english for kids&#8221;</em> in France. This remarkable achievement highlights the effectiveness of our promotional efforts in maximizing the app&#8217;s visibility and driving its success in the target market.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/09.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-6" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/09-1024x546.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6108" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/09-1024x546.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/09-300x160.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/09-768x410.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/09-740x395.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/09.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As you know, we work with different categories of apps in keyword promotion and it is needed to say that we have a huge experience not only in tool apps promotion like VPN, PDF readers etc, but in games as well. Of course, we would like to mention that games promotion is one of the hardest as the competitiveness is quite high. Anyway, according to the statistics, in Games category the search organic traffic varies from 20 to 90% depending on the category, so it is needed to consider the keyword promotion as a marketing tool for game apps as well.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that promotion of each application can differ significantly, so the results could be different as well. As our promotion influences only app positions for keywords, there are some other factors that depend on your work with the app:</p>



<ul><li>in-app activity</li><li>application history</li><li>app page quality</li><li>organic installs amount</li><li>current ranks of relevant keywords</li><li>app reputation</li></ul>



<p>In the following case study we would like to tell more about RPG games promotion, keywords popular in this category as well as the promotion strategies we used to get top ranks for search requests. We would like you to pay attention to the apps, keywords and regions which were promoted. In our experience (you can see it in the provided examples), it is effective to promote games not only in the most popular regions, like the USA, but in other ones as well. So here we want to give you some examples of keywords they are ranking for and groups of keywords they are now promoted in search by specific region. We recommend you to pay attention to the number of installs and days in the campaign and how many positions this app increased in search for, as it is extremely important to remember that promotion strategy for Google Play and AppStore differs a lot because of differences in their algorithm work. By the way, you can read more about this in the following <a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/app-promotion/difference-between-google-play-and-appstore-algorithms/">article</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s start with Google Play examples. As you could remember, the most wide-spread strategy for Android apps promotion is setting campaigns for 5-7 days on average and using the everyday increase of the amount of installs for each promoted keyword, as well as promotion of the search request with the same core element in groups.</p>



<p>The first keyword we worked with is <em>“mmorpg”</em>. The app was promoted in the US and starting position it has for this search request was 183. As the position was quite low, we have started with low amount of installs despite the fact that the keyword and region are competitive, the score of the request according to our platform is 51, what makes it popular. We have started with 40 installs daily and increased this amount for 5 installs. Below you can see the 5-day campaign settings.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-01-1024x152.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5258" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-01-1024x152.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-01-300x45.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-01-768x114.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-01-740x110.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-01.png 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>After the first test campaign we managed to achieve top 40 for the keyword. Obviously we have decided to continue the promotion, as our main aim was to hit top 5 for this request in the US. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-02-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5259" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-02-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-02-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-02-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-02-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-02.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The next campaign we set was already for 7 days and with higher amount of downloads. We have started with 60 for the 1st day and increase the number for 10-20 installs every day. Below you can check the campaign settings.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-03-1024x152.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5260" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-03-1024x152.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-03-300x45.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-03-768x114.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-03-740x110.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-03.png 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>After this campaign we managed to get top 5 for the keyword in 3 days after the campaign was finished. The increase graphic you can check below. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-04-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5261" width="1024" height="558" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-04-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-04-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-04-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-04-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-04.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>It is necessary to mention that alongside the other keywords with the element <em>“mmorpg”</em> were promoted, so to support the main one and provide the more stable increase.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The next example is as well for Google Play and the keyword we worked with is <em>“rpg idle”.</em> The promotion was conducted for Great Britain. The starting position of the app for this request was 210, so it is almost the end of the search list. That’s why the first aim we were trying to achieve was to increase the rank at least to top 20, so to be able to work with higher amounts for achieving of top 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anyway, the first campaign was the screening one and we have started the promotion with low amounts as well as added the other connected keywords, such as <em>“rpg idle online game”, “rpg idle for free”.</em> These are the keywords of low popularity, so we set the very minimum for them, like 5-10 installs daily just to show Google that the application gets the installs for the similar keywords as well. Below you may see the setting for the keyword <em>“rpg idle”</em> for 2 conducted campaigns.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-05-1024x152.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5262" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-05-1024x152.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-05-300x45.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-05-768x114.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-05-740x110.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-05.png 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-06-1024x152.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5263" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-06-1024x152.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-06-300x45.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-06-768x114.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-06-740x110.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-06.png 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>After the first campaign we managed to achieve top 20, and after this with the help of the second campaign for 7 days the main aim of top 3 was achieved. The increase graphic you can check below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-07-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5264" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-07-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-07-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-07-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-07-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-07.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Now let’s check the example for iOS application. The keyword we worked with in the US region is <em>“rpg merge games”.</em> As you remember, the promotion strategy for AppStore differs and there is no need to make long campaigns for 5-7 days as for Android. So it is completely enough to set the first test campaign for 1-2 days to check how the keyword reacts to promotion and then stick to the same strategy with short campaigns, but with higher amount of used installs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have started as well with the position 100, which is considered to be low, so for the first campaign we set 50 installs daily for 2 days to test the reaction to promotion. Below you can see the setting for the campaign for the keyword <em>“rpg merge games”</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-08-1024x152.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5265" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-08-1024x152.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-08-300x45.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-08-768x114.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-08-740x110.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-08.png 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>After the first campaign we managed to increase the rank to top 10 as it may be seen on the graphic.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-09-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5266" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-09-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-09-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-09-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-09-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-09.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>After the first campaign we set one more to get top ranks. So we decided to increase an amount and set 100 installs daily for 1 day. This brought us top 1 for this keyword in the US. Check the increase graphic below. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-10-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5267" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-10-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-10-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-10-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-10-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/case-rpg-10.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>

<p>We help to promote many Qr Сode apps and the main groups of keywords are not only high-frequency competitive keywords like “qr code” or “qr”. It is possible to gain more organictraffic from the promotion of less popular but more precise keywords: “qr code scanner” with 1000 daily traffic, “code scanner” with 700, and “code reader” with 500. It is needed to mention that according to the statistics provided by <a href="https://www.storemaven.com/glossary/app-store-search/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Storemaven</a> app store search traffic drives around 70% of installs in the App Store and Google Play, so it is definitely worth promoting your app using keyword installs. While the app gets higher positions in the search, you may start seeing more organic installs as the app becomes more visible and noticeable when users look for the search request on the store.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that the promotion of each application can differ significantly, so the results could be different as well. As our promotion influences only app positions for keywords, there are some other factors that depend on your work with the app:</p>



<ul><li>in-app activity</li><li>application history</li><li>app page quality (icon and screenshots)</li><li>organic installs amount</li><li>current ranks of relevant keywords</li><li>app reputation</li></ul>



<p>In this case study, we would like you to pay attention to the apps, keywords, and regions that were promoted as well as the results which we managed to achieve. In our experience (you can see it in the provided examples), it is effective to promote QR reader apps not only in the most popular regions, like the USA but in other ones as well. So here we want to give you some examples of apps, keywords they are ranking for and groups of keywords they were promoted in search by specific regions. We recommend you pay attention to the number of installs and days in the campaign and how many positions this app increased in search for.</p>



<p>The following example shows a campaign for 5 days with 300 installs in general for the Android application. As you can see, the <strong>“qrcode”</strong> keyword has reached rank 2 after the promotion. (+6) shows how many ranks have been raised. To boost the app to the top rank for the keyword we have used the strategy which is usually recommended for Google Play promotion campaigns: the length of the campaign was set 5 days (for Google Play it is better to spread the installs for 5-7 days at least as Google algorithm reacts on such type of campaign better and needs more time to be shown that app gets installs for particular search request) and the number of installs was increased every day. The second screenshot shows the order details, how many installs were set daily, how many installs were delivered, and total information about the number of installs used for the keyword.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-01-1024x276.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5177" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-01-1024x276.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-01-300x81.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-01-768x207.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-01-740x199.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-01.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-02-1024x152.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5178" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-02-1024x152.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-02-300x45.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-02-768x114.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-02-740x110.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-02.png 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Next, you can see a growth statistic of the <strong>“qrcode”</strong> keyword in the USA. Ups and downs of the rank are normal during the first few days of promotion because the algorithm often takes 3-5 days to update changes after the order was completed. As our promotion is a step-by-step promotion, even two weeks are normal for that kind of growth.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-03-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5179" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-03-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-03-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-03-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-03-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-03.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Let’s check one more example for Google Play. In the following case, we promoted the application for the keyword <strong>“qr scanner free”</strong>. The application was promoted as well for 5 days which is the most commonly used strategy for Android, but the region we had a campaign in is already Great Britain. The next screenshots show the campaign settings. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-04-1024x276.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5180" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-04-1024x276.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-04-300x81.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-04-768x207.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-04-740x199.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-04.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-05-1024x152.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5181" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-05-1024x152.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-05-300x45.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-05-768x114.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-05-740x110.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-05.png 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>If you check the keyword growth graphic, you may see that we have started the promotion from the 57th position, and as a result, we managed to achieve top 7. The total number of used installs for the campaign was 100.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-06-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5182" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-06-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-06-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-06-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-06-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-06.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Now let’s check some examples for iOS. It is needed to mention that usually for iOS apps keyword promotion more installs are needed and also there is no need to spread the campaign for 5-7 days, it will be completely enough to promote for 1-3 days, as the Apple algorithm works a completely different way and processes all the installs received for keyword faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first example is for the USA. As you may see from the campaign settings, the order was set for 3 days with 240 installs in total per keyword. Using such a strategy we managed to achieve the top 10 for 2 of promoted keywords and the top 20 for another one.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-07-1024x450.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5183" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-07-1024x450.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-07-300x132.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-07-768x337.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-07-740x325.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-07.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>If we check the growth graphic for <strong>“qr code reader”</strong> keyword, we may see that the starting position was the 75th and after the campaign, we managed to achieve the top 5. Please, pay attention that the result for iOS campaigns may be observed already the next day after the installs were added, as the Apple algorithm doesn’t require a lot of time to proceed with all the changes in the app list for the search request. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-08-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5184" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-08-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-08-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-08-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-08-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-08.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The next example of such app category promotion is for Australia. We set a 1-day campaign with 100 installs and managed to achieve +89 positions within several days. In the following screenshots, you may see the campaign settings. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-09-1024x276.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5185" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-09-1024x276.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-09-300x81.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-09-768x207.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-09-740x199.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-09.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-10-1024x152.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5186" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-10-1024x152.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-10-300x45.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-10-768x114.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-10-740x110.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-10.png 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Let’s check the growth graphic for this keyword. As you can see, we started with the rank 94, and after the keyword installs campaign the position achieved is the 5th. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-11-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5187" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-11-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-11-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-11-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-11-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/case-qr-11.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<p>People usually care about their private life and want to have someone to talk with. We help to promote many dating apps and the main groups of keywords are not only high frequency competitive keywords like “dating” or “dating app”. It is possible to gain more traffic from promotion of less popular but more precise keywords: “mature dating” with 2000 daily traffic, “dating apps free” with 600, “find a friend” with 300. Apps that are in the top 10 combine 80% of keywords daily traffic, so it is worth promoting your app using keyword installs. You start seeing more organic installs as you hit the top 10 spots with high traffic keywords.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that promotion of each application can differ significantly, so the results could be different as well. As our promotion influence only app positions for keywords, there are some other factors that depend on your work with the app: </p>



<ul><li>in-app activity</li><li>application history </li><li>app page quality</li><li>organic installs amount</li><li>current ranks of relevant keywords</li></ul>



<p>Here we would like you to pay attention to the apps, keywords and regions which were promoted. In our experience (you can see it in the provided examples), it is effective to promote dating apps not only in the most popular regions, like the USA, but in other ones as well. So here we want to give you some examples of apps, keywords they are ranking for and groups of keywords they are now promoted in search by specific region. We recommend you to pay attention to the number of installs and days in the campaign and how many positions this app increased in search for.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-01.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-01.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4967" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-01.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-01-300x120.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-01-768x308.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-01-740x297.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-02.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-02.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4968" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-02.png 799w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-02-300x84.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-02-768x215.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-02-740x207.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>Here you can see a campaign for 5 days with 1685 installs in general. For example, “asian dating” keyword has reached rank 6 after the promotion. (+5) shows how many ranks have been  raised. In the second screenshot, you can see the order details, how many installs were set daily, how many installs were delivered and total information about the amount of installs used for each keyword.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-03.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-03.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4969" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-03.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-03-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-03-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/case-dating-03-740x403.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>Next you can see a growth statistic of the “asian dating apps” keyword in USA. Ups and downs of the rank are normal during the first few days of promotion, because the Algorithm often takes 3 days to update changes. We started the campaign on February 18th and we lost some ranks by the 20th of February. Then it grew up on the day after it and we reached rank 6 on February 26th. As our promotion is step by step promotion, two weeks are normal for that kind of growth.</p>

<p>Here you can see an example for iOS. You can’t set up a different number of daily installs for iOS campaigns, so we recommend setting up 3-5 days campaigns and increasing installs for next orders. Also, usually you need more installs to rank up with iOS apps.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As we have already discussed previously in one of our <a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/app-promotion/difference-between-google-play-and-appstore-algorithms/">articles</a>, promotion process, as well as algorithm work, on Google Play and AppStore differ a lot, so in this article we decided to show some cases particularly of iOS apps boost, so to show that it is possible to to get top ranks even on AppStore in different app categories.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><em>It is needed to mention, that keyword boost on AppStore may be more difficult because of the next reasons:</em></h4>



<ul><li><em>more installs are needed to push the app for the keyword to top</em></li><li><em>the competitiveness in popular regions (for example, the US) may be higher than for Google Play.</em></li></ul>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Please note that it is just an approximate strategy for different keywords and regions, as it is needed to remember that every application is unique, so its story of promotion will be unique as well. Despite this, for each app there are the same factors that influence the app boost, and success of promotion.</p>



<ul><li>in-app activity</li><li>application history&nbsp;</li><li>app page quality</li><li>organic installs amount</li><li>current ranks of relevant keywords</li></ul>



<p>The first app we worked with is from the <strong>category “Photo &amp; Video”.</strong> The app was promoted in <strong>Great Britain</strong> for the <strong>keyword “reel maker”</strong>. The position we have started from was 21st, the keyword popularity &#8211; 33 what maked it the keyword of middle competitiveness. First of all, we see that the app was almost in top 20 for the request where the competitiveness is already higher, so we decided to set 100 for 1 day to check the keyword position reaction to promotion. With this amount of installs we managed to achieve the 4th rank, so as our main aim was to get top 5, we didn’t increase the daily amount further, just decided to create a campaign to keep the position setting 20-30 installs daily. As a result, we managed to keep the position, what can be seen from the graphic below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-01.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4933" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-01.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-01-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-01-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-01-740x403.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<p>he next app we worked with was from the <strong>category “Business</strong>” and the keyword we were focused on &#8211; <strong>“cv maker”. </strong>In this case the aim was to try to achieve top 3 in the US. The starting position of the app was 25th, and the keyword score is 31, what makes it middle-frequency keyword. We analyzed the statistics of changes of the rank as well as the previous keyword campaigns conducted and decided that we would start with 75 installs daily to check the keyword reaction. With this amount we managed to achieve top 6 for the keyword what can be seen on the graphic. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-02.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4934" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-02.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-02-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-02-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-02-740x403.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>As our main aim was top 3, in several days we decided to continue the promotion and increase the daily amount of installs to 125. With this amount we managed to get top 2 and at this stage the app still keeps this rank already with organic downloads. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-03.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4935" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-03.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-03-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-03-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-03-740x403.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<p>The next app is from the <strong>“Finance” category.</strong> The app was promoted for the <strong>keyword “secure wallet” in Canada</strong>. The position we started from was 16th and the main aim was to achieve exactly top 1 for this request. The keyword popularity is 42 which makes it already the request of high-frequency. As the application was already in top 20 for the popular keyword, we decided that it is needed to start with 100+ installs. As you may see from the graphic, we achieved top 1 within 1 day, but then didn’t stop the installs, and added 40 daily during a week to keep the position. The rank is fixed and now the app already keeps it with organic downloads.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-04.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4936" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-04.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-04-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-04-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-04-740x403.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<p>The last example we would like to show is for app from <strong>“Productivity” category.</strong> The <strong>keywords</strong> we worked with is <strong>“ad blocker” in the US</strong>. The starting rank of the app for this keyword was 79 and the keyword popularity is 56, so it is already a high-frequency search request. As the start position is quite low, we decided that there is no need to start with high amount of installs and used 40 installs daily for the 1st campaign. With such an approach, we managed to increase the rank to 33 what can be seen on the graphic. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-05.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4937" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-05.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-05-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-05-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-05-740x403.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<p>After this we increased the daily amount of installs for approximately 40% and used already 60 installs daily for the next campaign. After that we managed to get top 20 for the keyword.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-06.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4938" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-06.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-06-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-06-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-06-740x403.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<p>To boost the app to top 5 we set a new campaign and used 120 installs daily for the 1st day and 150 for the 2nd. As a result, the app hit top 3 for this request what can be seen on the following screenshot. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-07.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4939" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-07.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-07-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-07-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/case-how-to-promote-ios-app-07-740x403.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>SUMMARY</strong></h3>



<p>As you may see with the examples provided, the most important thing in iOS promotion is to use more installs as you do for Google Play if you have promoted Android applications before and try to make short campaigns, as there is no need to set 5-7 days as we do for Google Play. One more method which can help to make the promotion successful is to set the campaign to keep the position. Usually, 30-40% of the amount used previously should be enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anyway, if you have any questions or need help with the strategy for your iOS application keyword boost, contact our support team or your personal manager. We can tell much more secrets about keyword promotion! </p>

<p>Some people want to test their luck. Every day we help to promote a lot of casino apps and the main groups of keywords are not only high frequency competitive keywords like “casino” or “poker”. It is possible to attract organic users with the help of promotion of less popular but more precise keywords: “real casino money”, “real casino”, “slots casino”.The closer the app is to the top, the more organic installs this app may receive. 80% of installs come for the 1st top-5 apps for a keyword.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would like to inform that every application is unique, so its story of promotion will be unique as well. Despite this,&nbsp; for each app&nbsp; there are the same factors that influence the app boost, and success of promotion. </p>



<ul><li>in-app activity</li><li>application history&nbsp;</li><li>app page quality</li><li>organic installs amount</li><li>current ranks of relevant keywords</li></ul>



<p> Here we want you to pay attention to the apps, keywords and regions which were promoted. In our experience casino apps are popular all over the world, especially for&nbsp; the European regions. So here we want to give you some examples of apps, and the strategy of promotion for a Portugal region (Android) and Sweden region (iOS). We recommend you to pay attention to the number of installs that were used, so you can build a similar strategy for your app. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-01.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-01-1024x309.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4783" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-01-1024x309.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-01-300x91.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-01-768x232.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-01-740x223.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-01.png 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p> For the promotion we have chosen 2 middle scored keywords for Portugal “casino dinheiro real” and “cassino online dinheiro real”. There is a campaign for 4 days, and it is seen that the&nbsp; number of installs increases every day from 10 installs to 40 installs daily per each keyword. This strategy helps to make the promotion look natural. In total we spent 200 installs for both keywords, which was enough to gain 30+ positions and reach top-40. That is the common strategy we usually recommend for Android apps promotion, as it is believed that Google algorithm reacts better to long campaigns (more than 3 days) and everyday increase in the amount of installs. This gives the understanding to the algorithm that the app receives the installs for the keyword on a permanent basis and the positions are increased. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-02.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-02-1024x186.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4784" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-02-1024x186.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-02-300x55.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-02-768x140.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-02-740x134.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-02.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p> Below you can see the charts for these keywords. On the 1st day of the promotion, the app had 59 and 69 ranks for keywords “casino dinheiro real” and “cassino online dinheiro real” respectively. Right app is closer to the top for both keywords, which makes it visible for more users, as we have already mentioned that most apps are downloaded from the top 10. </p>

<p>As you may see with our cases, we use the different amount of installs for keyword in each different case. If you are still asking yourself how to choose the right amount of downloads to boost your app positions, read the following <a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/app-promotion/how-many-keyword-installs-do-you-need/">article</a>. </p>



<p> Now let’s talk about iOS app promotion of the same app category. Below you can see the results of the promotion for an iOS app in Great Britain for the middle-scored&nbsp; keywords “real money slots”, “blackjack”, “casino real money app”,&nbsp; “online gambling”. The strategy of promotion of iOS and Android apps is very different. We recommend starting the promotion with a small number of installs, to check how these keywords react to promotion. Starting with a big number of installs makes the promotion look not natural and suspicious for Apple. We have set orders for 4 days with 10 installs daily per each keyword. Mostly all of them reached top-5 </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="blob:https://keyapp.top/46ef37bd-d0d5-48dd-93d4-d3a36949bdf1"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-05-2-1024x377.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4830" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-05-2-1024x377.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-05-2-300x110.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-05-2-768x282.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-05-2-740x272.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-05-2.png 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p> Using the example of the keyword “real money slots” we can see that this strategy helped to boost the app for 150+&nbsp; positions. 10 installs were delivered every day for 4 days </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="blob:https://keyapp.top/46507037-7453-4a0e-8ee7-f54f89e3ef4a"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-06-1-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4828" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-06-1-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-06-1-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-06-1-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-06-1-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case-сasino-betting-Europe-06-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p> As you may see from the examples above, promotion of casino apps may be completely successful in different countries of Europe and for different keywords. It is just needed to pay attention to the store, as strategies differ, and choose the right amount of installs depending on the keyword score and current position of the app for this request. Our support team is ready to help you with all the campaign settings, as we know the current trends in keywords promotion and the most efficient strategies that will help your app to achieve top positions in search!  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Brain-training games are very popular today on both AppStore and PlayStore. Sudoku, Tiles, Solitaire and other puzzles are promoted every day on our platform. We help to push these games for a wide range of relevant keywords. Among keywords of high popularity we deal with every day are “mahjong”, “solitaire”, “sudoku”, “sudoku offline” and many others. In order to get traffic, we also boost apps for less popular, but still relevant keywords like “sudoku games free”, “solitaire games free”, “free cell solitaire”, “mahjong games online” etc. All the apps in top-10 collect 80% of the keywords daily traffic. Hence, you need to push your app to the top with keywords installs to receive organic traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A promotional approach and promotional results depend on the particular app. Keywords installs can help to boost the app to the top, but you have to remember about other factors, which influence the results of promotion the app may have:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>in-app activity&nbsp;</li><li>application history&nbsp;</li><li>app page quality&nbsp;</li><li>organic installs amount&nbsp;</li><li>current ranks of relevant keywords </li></ul>



<p>We would like to share our experience in promoting card and puzzle apps for different regions and keywords. After many years of promoting apps of these categories, we have realized that promoting apps for many regions is more efficient than for one country only. In this case, we will provide examples of apps, which are promoted for many countries and for different types of keywords. Pay special attention to the position changes and the number of installs we set for the given period of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first example is the promotion of an Android app. As you can see, we have run a 5 days order with 2250 installs, using a step-by-step strategy with an everyday increase in the amount of installs. All both keywords in this order reached top-3 by the end of the campaign. You can see the current positions for the promoted keywords and the number of delivered installs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the order details on the second screenshot, you can see the number of installs we set for each keyword. The keywords in this campaign have high scores and the campaign was started when both keywords were in top-20 already. Therefore they needed 100+ installs to reach the top. The keyword “mahjong solitaire” after 1250 installs raised from the 18 position to top-1.</p>

<p> On the next screen you can see the graph of the growth of the keyword “mahjong solitaire”. As you can see, step-by-step strategy works the best for PlayStore. The rank grew by the end of the campaign, however it also may take a few days for the rank to grow. It is normal for android apps, as it takes 2-3 days for Google Play algorithms to calculate and update the information about installs in the console. Hence, the ranks improvement may also be reflected in a few days after the campaign is completed. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-03.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-03-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4702" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-03-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-03-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-03-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-03-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-03.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>Now let’s talk about iOS app promotion of the same category. For iOS, the promotion strategy is a bit different. Usually, you need more installs daily to push the app, then for android promotion. Therefore, you have to make small orders for 1-3 days and elevate the number of installs per order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is an example of a 3-day campaign with 300 installs, which helped to boost keywords to top-2.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-04.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-04-1-1024x276.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4707" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-04-1-1024x276.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-04-1-300x81.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-04-1-768x207.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-04-1-740x199.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-04-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p> On the screen below you can check the graphic of the increase for the keyword “<strong>Classic Solitaire</strong>”. We have started from the 53 position and after the installs were delivered keyword achieved rank 2 in the GB. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-05.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-4" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-05-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4704" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-05-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-05-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-05-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-05-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/case-sudoku-05.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Everyone may face the period when the loan app may be needed, so at our side we help to promote many of such apps and the main groups of keywords are not only high frequency competitive keywords like “borrow money” or “loan app”. It is possible to gain more traffic from promotion of less popular but more precise keywords: “borrow money now” with 2000 daily traffic, “free money borrowing” with 600, “real payday loans” with 300. Apps that are in the top 10 combine 80% of keywords daily traffic, so it is worth promoting your app using keyword installs. You start seeing more organic installs as you hit the top 10 spots with high traffic keywords.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that promotion of each application can differ significantly, so the results could be different as well. As our promotion influence only app positions for keywords, there are some other factors that depend on your work with the app:</p>



<ul><li>in-app activity</li><li>application history&nbsp;</li><li>app page quality</li><li>organic installs amount</li><li>current ranks of relevant keywords</li></ul>



<p> In the next case we would like you to pay attention to the apps, keywords and regions which were promoted. In our experience (you can see it in the provided examples), it is effective to promote loan apps not only in the most popular regions, like the USA, but in other geos as well. So here we want to give you some examples of apps, keywords they are ranking for and groups of keywords they are now promoted in search by specific region. We recommend you to pay attention to the number of installs and days in the campaign and how many positions this app increased in search for. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-01.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-01-1-1024x445.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4670" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-01-1-1024x445.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-01-1-300x130.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-01-1-768x333.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-01-1-740x321.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-01-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p> Here you can see a campaign for 5 days with 2750 installs in general. For example, “payday loan app” keyword has reached rank 3 after the promotion. (+4) shows how many ranks have been raised. In the second screenshot, you can see the order details, how many installs were set daily, how many installs were delivered and total information about the amount of installs used for each keyword. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-02.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-02-1024x354.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4655" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-02-1024x354.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-02-300x104.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-02-768x266.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-02-740x256.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-02.png 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p> Next you can see a growth statistic of the “payday loan app” keyword in USA. Ups and downs of the rank are normal during the first few days of promotion, because the Google algorithm often takes 3 days to update changes. We started the campaign on April 13th and we lost some ranks by the 16th of April. Then it grew up on the day after it and we reached rank 3 on April 18th. As our promotion is step by step promotion, two weeks are normal for that kind of growth. Please, keep in mind that Google algorithm works really in a different way than Apple’s if you worked only with iOS apps before. While working with Google we may see the rank increase in some time after the installs are delivered. As we said previously, usually it is 3 days, but it may take even up to 7-10 days. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-03.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-03-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4656" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-03-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-03-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-03-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-03-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-03.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>By the way, have you ever though why we usually provide the examples both for Google Play and AppStore? The answer is quite easy, as both app store optimization and keywords promotion on these stores differ a lot. To get more details, read the following <a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/app-promotion/difference-between-google-play-and-appstore-algorithms/">article</a> in our blog.</p>



<p> Next example is for iOS app promotion of the same category in the US. We recommend setting up 1-3 days campaigns for AppStore as it is believed that Apple algorithmalgorith reacts better when a higher amount of installs is delivered within the shorter period of time, while Google likes when the installs are being delivered for longer period of time. Also, usually more installs for keyword daily are needed, as Apple algorithm mostly pay attention to the amount of installs the app receives daily for the particular keyword and increase the position, while any additionalassitional actions as returns in the app etc are not required. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-04-1024x377.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-04-1-1024x377.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4671" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-04-1-1024x377.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-04-1-300x110.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-04-1-768x282.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-04-1-740x272.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-04-1.png 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-05.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-4" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-05-1024x253.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4658" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-05-1024x253.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-05-300x74.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-05-768x190.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-05-740x183.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-05.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p> On the next screen you may see the graphic which shows the increase of the keyword “money loan app”. As you may see, we used the same amount daily during 3 days. The result from the installs is observed at once all the downloads were delivered. That is what we mentioned before, that Apple requires less time to update the positions and we may see the result at once as their algorithm proceeds the installs delivered faster and reacts with the position increase. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-06.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-5" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-06-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4659" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-06-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-06-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-06-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-06-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-loan-iosandroid-06.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In modern life we can’t imagine a day without using translators: for traveling, stadies, watching movies or translating the ingredients of the noodles from a Chinese shop. Translator apps will be always in need. <br>
Every day we help to promote many translator apps and the main groups of keywords are not only high-frequency competitive keywords as “translator”. You can gain more traffic from promotion of less popular, but relevant keywords: “translation app”, “voice translator”, “all translation” etc. The closer the app is to the top, the more organic installs this app may receive. 80% of installs come for the 1st top-5 apps for a keyword. </p>



<p>We would like to inform that every application is unique, so its story of promotion will be unique as well. Despite this,  for each app  there are the same factors that influence the app boost, and success of promotion.</p>



<ul><li>in-app activity</li><li>application history </li><li>app page quality</li><li>organic installs amount</li><li>current ranks of relevant keywords</li></ul>



<p>Here we want you to pay attention to the apps, keywords and regions which were promoted. In our experience translation apps are popular all over the world, especially for  the European regions. So here we want to give you some examples of apps, and the strategy of promotion for a German region (Android) and France region (iOS). We recommend you to pay attention to the number of installs that were used, so you can build a similar strategy for your app.</p>



<p> </p>

<p>For the promotion we have chosen 2 middle scored keywords for Germany “sprachen übersetzer” and “übersetzungs app”. There is a campaign for 6 days, and it is seen that the&nbsp; number of installs increases every day from 10 installs to 45 installs daily per each keyword. This strategy helps to make the promotion look natural. In total we spent 300 installs for both keywords, which was enough to gain 100+ positions and reach top-5. That is the common strategy we usually recommend for Android apps promotion, as it is believed that Google algorithm reacts better to long campaigns and everyday increase in the amount of installs. This gives the understanding to the algorithm that app receives the installs for the keyword on a permanent basis and the positions are increased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below you can see the charts for these keywords. In the 1st day of the promotion, the app had 161 and 180 ranks for keywords “sprachen übersetzer” and “übersetzungs app” accordingly. Normally, users don’t scroll that far to install the app. After 6 days of promotion, the app reached 5th and 4th position for these keywords accordingly. It made the app noticeable, so the number of organic installs was enough to keep the app in these positions without additional installs, as the charts&nbsp; perfectly show this.</p>

<p> Now let’s talk about iOS app promotion of the same category. Below you can see the results of the promotion for an iOS app in the France region for the middle-scored&nbsp; keyword “traducteur vocal” . The strategy of promotion of iOS and Android apps is very different. Before the campaign, the app already was in top-34, and it is a fact that the closer the app is to the top, the more installs it may need to boost it. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-05.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-4" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-05-1024x316.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4642" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-05-1024x316.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-05-300x93.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-05-768x237.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-05-740x228.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-05.png 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p> First, we made an order for 1 day with 125 installs as the first boost, and it helped the app to reach top-4 (+30 positions) immediately, as you can see on the chart. For iOS it is more difficult to keep the rank, so we set a new order for 14 days with 30 installs daily, so the app keeps its position, and gaining more organic installs to keep it at the top. As you may see the strategy for iOS apps differs from the strategy for Android apps. First of all, it may be needed to use more installs within one day as Apple algorithm reacts better on such installs delivery and pays attention to how many installs are received within the day for the keyword, so for Apple it is not important if this amount was spread within several days. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-06.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-5" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-06-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4643" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-06-1024x558.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-06-300x164.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-06-768x419.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-06-740x403.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/case-translator-iOSandroid-06.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eh, our week of cases has come to an end. Do not be sad,there are more exciting posts waiting for you in the near future!</p>
<p>And today we will close our case marathon with a simple case of one of our clients in Brazil!</p>
<p><strong>Our client’s application is a messenger, and he decided to promote it in Brazil.</strong> The client’s <strong>strategy is very simple: 1 day and 20/30 installations per request.</strong> In total, the client received 200 installations and as a result, he raised positions, some of which are now in the Google Play TOP.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at the most successful changes. For example, the keyword <strong>Chat messenger.</strong> The request was at 137 positions, and now at 3rd place. And the keyword <strong>mensageiro gratuito</strong> was in 133rd place, but now it takes 1st place in the search. Also, the word <strong>mensageiro grátis</strong> was in 106th place, and now in 2nd!</p>
