<p>In a world where mobile applications spread at a staggering pace, the task of standing out among competitors becomes more important than ever. ASO (App Store Optimization) serves as the foundation for app developers and marketers. ASO helps to gain increased visibility, attract users, and ultimately increase the number of downloads. In an environment where millions of apps compete for attention on various platforms, mastering ASO has become not only a useful tactic but also a crucial strategy for achieving success.</p>



<p>Today, we will delve into the nuances of ASO, exploring strategies that enhance an application&#8217;s visibility. From unraveling the intricacies of optimizing keywords to harnessing the persuasive power of visual resources, each section will present practical ideas and proven tactics that will expand the capabilities of both developers and marketers.</p>



<p><strong>This comprehensive guide explores the key strategies to skyrocket your app&#8217;s visibility and drive organic downloads.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Keyword Mastery: The Language of Discovery</strong></h2>



<p>Imagine your app store listing as a conversation with potential users. Keywords are the bridge that connects your app&#8217;s features and benefits to their search queries. Mastering keyword research is crucial. Tools like App Annie and Sensor Tower can unearth relevant and high-volume keywords users employ to find apps like yours. Optimize your app title, description, and category by weaving in these keywords organically, but avoid keyword stuffing – user experience remains paramount. Also, don&#8217;t forget that on the KeyApp.top platform, you can make use of our free ASO tools. You can read more about the capabilities <a href="https://keyapp.top/free-aso-tools">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Visual Storytelling: Capturing Attention at First Glance</strong></p>



<p>Your app icon and screenshots serve as the initial visual representations and hold significant importance. Design a captivating icon that swiftly communicates your app&#8217;s core identity, standing out amidst a multitude of ordinary icons. Moreover, it&#8217;s crucial to consider localization and adapt imagery to suit the targeted market when venturing into new territories.</p>



<p>Your screenshots should narrate a compelling story, highlighting the most appealing features and user advantages offered by your app. Incorporate vibrant visuals, incorporate clear call-to-actions, and curate an intuitive sequence that effectively communicates your app&#8217;s unique value proposition. Remember, when expanding into different markets, ensuring localization and adapting visuals appropriately is paramount for optimal results.</p>



<h2><strong>Rating &amp; Review: Building Trust, Authority, and User Engagement</strong></h2>



<p>In the bustling app marketplace, ratings and reviews are the currency of trust and authority. They wield immense power in shaping potential users&#8217; perceptions and influence the credibility of your app. Acquiring positive feedback isn&#8217;t merely about accumulating stars; it&#8217;s about cultivating a community of satisfied users willing to vouch for your app&#8217;s quality.</p>



<p>To foster a positive review culture, prioritize delivering exceptional user experiences. From seamless navigation to impeccable functionality, each interaction should aim to delight users. Additionally, timely and sincere responses to user feedback—both positive and negative—underscore your commitment to user satisfaction and amplify your app&#8217;s credibility.</p>



<p>Proactively prompt users for feedback within your app, strategically timing these prompts to follow successful interactions or notable achievements. Crafting unobtrusive in-app prompts encourages users to share their experiences effortlessly, enhancing the likelihood of positive reviews. However, it&#8217;s crucial to respect users&#8217; time and engagement, ensuring these prompts don&#8217;t disrupt their experience or feel intrusive.</p>



<p>Moreover, when dealing with negative feedback, approach it as an opportunity to showcase your dedication to improvement. Address concerns promptly, offering solutions or explanations where necessary. Engaging with dissatisfied users publicly demonstrates your attentiveness and willingness to rectify issues, potentially transforming a negative experience into a positive one.</p>



<h2><strong>Conversion Optimization</strong></h2>



<p>To achieve the result, namely receiving a download from the user, you need to approach the development of the user path wisely.</p>



<p>Begin by strategically presenting your app&#8217;s Unique Selling Points (USPs) prominently within the description. Craft this section with concise and compelling language that clearly communicates the primary benefits and features of your app. Utilize bullet points and numbered lists to break down information, enhancing readability and allowing users to quickly grasp the app&#8217;s key offerings.</p>



<p>Incorporating user testimonials and showcasing positive app store badges can significantly bolster trust and credibility. Genuine user feedback, supplemented with accolades or endorsements, serves as social proof, validating your app&#8217;s value proposition. Visual elements like high ratings, awards, or recognition by authoritative sources instill confidence in potential downloaders, elevating your app above the competition.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the power of a persuasive call-to-action (CTA) cannot be underestimated. A compelling and action-oriented phrase such as &#8220;Download Now&#8221; or &#8220;Get Started&#8221; can be the gentle nudge that persuades hesitant users to take the crucial step of installing your app. Ensure that this CTA is strategically placed, visibly standing out within the description, guiding users towards the desired action seamlessly.</p>



<p>Continual refinement and A/B testing of various elements within the app listing, including the description, visuals, and CTAs, can provide valuable insights into what resonates best with your audience. Remember, the goal is not just to attract attention but to seamlessly guide users through a compelling journey that culminates in the installation of your app, turning browsers into engaged and active users.</p>



<p>Remember, the authenticity of reviews matters. Encourage genuine opinions rather than incentivized or artificial feedback. Building a community of satisfied users who willingly advocate for your app fosters trust and loyalty, enhancing your app&#8217;s reputation and solidifying its position in the competitive app market.</p>



<h2><strong>A/B Testing: Continuous Learning and Improvement</strong></h2>



<p>ASO is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix. A/B testing different app listing elements – keywords, icons, screenshots, descriptions – allows you to measure what resonates with your target audience. Experiment with different variations and track their performance using app store analytics tools. This data-driven approach helps you refine your ASO strategy and maximize app visibility over time.</p>



<h2><strong>Beyond the Basics: Advanced ASO Tactics</strong></h2>



<p>For apps competing in fiercely contested categories, consider these advanced tactics:</p>



<ul><li>Localization: Adapt your app store listing content and visuals to resonate with international audiences.</li><li>Video Previews: Showcasing your app in action can dramatically increase conversion rates.</li><li>App Store Search Ads: Pay-per-install advertising within app stores can target specific keywords and drive high-quality traffic.</li><li>Seasonal ASO: Leverage holidays and cultural events to tailor your app store listing and attract relevant users.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Remember</strong>: ASO is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistency and data-driven decision-making are key to long-term success. By implementing these strategies and monitoring your progress, you can turn your app into a beacon of visibility, attracting countless users and propelling your app to the top of the charts.</p>



<p><strong>Bonus Tip</strong>: Stay informed about the latest app store algorithm updates and adapt your ASO strategy accordingly. Knowledge is power in the ever-evolving landscape of app store optimization.</p>



<p>With persistence, constant testing, and the right tools, your ASO efforts can be the magic wand that will lead you to dozens, even hundreds of installs. And if you still have questions about ASO topics, you can always contact our technical support managers, they will be happy to help you promote your application.</p>

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of app stores, App Store Optimization (ASO) has played a pivotal role in helping app developers increase their visibility, attract users, and drive downloads. However, as we look towards the future, it&#8217;s important to recognize that the traditional approaches to ASO may face new challenges and require adaptation to remain effective. In this article, we explore the question: Why will ASO not work in 2024, and how not to screw up with ASO in the future?</p>



<ul>

<li><a href="#why"><u>Why is ASO so important for mobile apps in 2024?</u></a></li>

<li><a href="#main"><u>The main mistakes that lead to non-working ASO </u></a> </li>

<li><a href="#how"><u>How do you avoid this mistake, which makes ASO less efficient than it could be?</u></a></li>

</ul>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="why"><strong>Why is ASO so important for mobile apps in 2024?</strong></h2>



<p>First of all, let’s discuss what ASO is. ASO is a process of improving an app&#8217;s visibility and user appeal in the app stores and increasing app conversion rates to get more downloads. So when you optimize the app in the first steps, you mostly work with text and visual optimization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the aims of ASO is to increase the app positions for search requests on Google Play or AppStore, while the other is a high click-through rate, or so-called CTR. To optimize for high CTR, it is needed to convince organic users to click on your app store listing once they find it and see it on the store. Typical CTR optimization includes your app name, app title, app icon, app screenshots, and app ratings.</p>



<p>You may ask why ASO is so important for mobile apps published on Google Play and AppStore? The answer is pretty simple, with the number of available apps now on Google Play and AppStore the competitiveness is extremely high, and more and more efforts are needed to attract organic users and make your application to be found by these users both in the search list and in different kinds of charts. This is also confirmed by the data from Statista showing how many apps are now on two main stores, over 3.55 million mobile apps on Google Play and 1.6 million on AppStore.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/01-1.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/01-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6208" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/01-1.png 800w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/01-1-300x204.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/01-1-768x521.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/01-1-740x502.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><figcaption><em><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It is widely known that the main goal for any app publisher is to get more downloads and grow the user base and App Store optimization is the right way to achieve this. Here are some main advantages of app optimization:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Improving app visibility and app positions in the search list. </strong></li></ul>



<p>Text app optimization influences the indexation process and the app positions for search requests on both stores. The way you added the keywords to the app name, title, and description will determine how successfully the app will get into the search list for the keywords.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Getting downloads by relevant users and increasing the number of organic users. </strong></li></ul>



<p>It is important for the app to be found and then downloaded by the users who are looking exactly for this type of app, as it influences the conversion rates. App Store Optimization directly influences the amount of organic traffic your application gets as </p>



<ol><li>Text optimization influences the indexation process and the app positions for search requests on both Stores</li><li>While visual optimization already has an impact on the way the application listing converts view to download.</li></ol>



<ul><li><strong>Increase app revenue and conversion rates</strong></li></ul>



<p>There are various ways to monetize your apps, such as in-app ads, in-app purchases, and subscription models. As a result, many of you may decide to run ads to bring in more users and, thus, more revenue. But if your app store listing page isn’t converting and convincing users to download your app, your ad spend will be wasted. Remember, app store optimization involves conversion rate optimization and getting people to click through and download the app.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="main"><strong>The main mistakes that lead to non-working ASO</strong></h2>



<p><strong>1. You do not create the strategy for App Store Optimization</strong></p>



<p>From our experience, most app developers and publishers do not think about optimization at the stage of app development and try to postpone this process as much as possible to the app release. But that is a completely wrong approach. I would recommend starting to work with ASO when you start to develop the app and trying to analyze all the details about the niche you are going to enter even before. But what is more important is that it is extremely important to create a strategy for your app optimization and plan all the steps you are going to follow on the way.</p>



<p><strong>2. You do not work with a keyword cloud </strong></p>



<p>Basically, keyword research is the first step you, as an app developer, must take before creating the text and proceeding with optimization. But many developers and marketers are making the same common mistakes here. One of them is targeting mostly high-volume keywords, not working with keyword suggestions and long-tail keywords, and in general, targeting too few keywords for the project—let’s say, less than 50.</p>



<p><strong>3. You do not localize the app</strong></p>



<p>App localization refers to <strong>the process of adapting the interface and functionality of a mobile application to suit foreign language markets,</strong> and of course, this gives the app the possibility of getting more downloads worldwide. Working on a daily basis with different types of apps, we can say that most app developers do not localize their apps for other markets, thinking that if the app itself is not translated, there is no sense in localization. Of course, for the best results in organic growth, the app itself should be translated to meet the user&#8217;s expectations, but before or in the process of content translation, you should start working with localization for the countries popular in your vertical, to get a sense of where the app may be popular.</p>



<p><strong>4. You optimize your app only once</strong></p>



<p>Have you ever thought about how often it is necessary to change something in visual or text optimization? If you thought that doing this one time when you launch an app is completely enough, we can say that it was a mistake. Some developers research keywords and make changes, but only once. For a few apps, the first set of changes improves downloads, but for most, it won&#8217;t because <strong>App Store optimization is an iterative process.</strong></p>



<p>This mistake is prevalent and costs developers a lot of potential downloads. It is, however, easy to fix. For App Store Optimization to work, you&#8217;ll need to try different things until you know what works, and then continue to optimize that. A simple way to iterate over ASO is to plan three different keyword sets and try each for about four weeks. After you&#8217;ve gone through all sets, take the parts from each that worked best, and double down on the keywords that worked while removing the ones that didn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>A keyword set is metadata that works with a specific theme of keywords. For example, if you have a translation app, one keyword set can revolve around the template of <em>&#8220;translate into (language)&#8221;</em> (ex. &#8220;translate into Spanish&#8221;). Another can be <em>&#8220;(language) into (another language)&#8221;</em> (ex. &#8220;Spanish into English&#8221;).</p>



<p><strong>5. You use the same strategy for Google Play and AppStore Optimization</strong></p>



<p>The main assets we work with in optimization are texts and visuals, but have you ever compared the ASO process for two main mobile markets? If not, we can say that Google Play and AppStore work in completely different ways, as is clearly observed in App store optimization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are the main differences between these two stores in terms of optimization.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/02-1-1024x681.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6209" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/02-1-1024x681.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/02-1-300x200.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/02-1-768x511.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/02-1-740x492.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/02-1.png 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>As we can see from the table provided, Google Play and AppStore check completely different fields to index the app for search requests. For example, while for Google Play app description is one of the main fields where a lot of keywords may be added due to the length of 4 000 characters, for AppStore the description has no weight and is used only to mention the app&#8217;s functionality and advantages in comparison to other apps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All these nuances should be paid attention to when you work with both stores simultaneously or start to work with one of the stores for the first time. </p>



<p><strong>6. You do not try increasing the app positions for keywords after ASO is done</strong></p>



<p>As we have discussed, the main aim of ASO is to increase conversion rates and the number of organic users. One of the main sources of app organic traffic is the installs from searches made by users who look for the app with any search request. By the way, this source of traffic is considered the biggest one in both stores.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So after you optimized the app, the best possible result achieved is, of course, the indexation for keywords, especially if the positions are quite high. But not in all cases can the app achieve top ranks for search requests, especially if they are competitive, and in such cases, developers are forced to look for additional tools after optimization is done. One such tool is keyword promotion, which is done with the help of keyword-targeted installs. First of all, let’s discuss what keyword promotion is. It is a process of app positions increasing in the search list for a particular search request. The main aim of keyword promotion is to get higher positions for keywords, which makes an app more noticeable and visible for organic users, which increases the app&#8217;s chances of getting more installs from the search.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This type of promotion is conducted in the following way: the app is optimized and gets into the index, so after this, you can set up the campaign at <a href="https://bit.ly/3Obrke2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keyapp</a>. Your app is found in the store for the search request and downloaded from the search list. In such a way, the store algorithm understands that the application is relevant for the search request looked for, gets installs for it, and the algorithm increases the positions in the list, making the application more visible. When the application gets at least to the top 5, it can start to get organic installs from the search request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To start the keyword promotion, it is needed: </p>



<ul><li>to optimize app texts and visuals</li><li>work out the app rating and reviews</li><li>check if the app is in the index for the keywords you would like to promote it for (so the app should be in the top 250 for the search requests).</li></ul>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>By the way, do not forget that you can check your app indexation for keywords completely for free using the Keyapp platform. There are no limitations on the number of requests or countries you can work with.</p></blockquote>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>At the same time, keyword promotion needs the right strategy to be chosen, as well as ASO depending on the store you work with. We have talked a lot about the <a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/app-promotion/difference-between-google-play-and-appstore-algorithms/">differences between the stores</a> and how keyword promotion is conducted using different approaches depending on the app store, but it is important to pay attention one more time to the general recommendations, which can help you&nbsp; create the strategy for your app keywords boosting. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/03-2-1024x594.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6212" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/03-2-1024x594.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/03-2-300x174.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/03-2-768x445.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/03-2-1536x891.png 1536w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/03-2-740x429.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/03-2.png 1780w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="how"><strong>How do you avoid this mistake, which makes ASO less efficient than it could be?</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Analyze the app market and the niche you are going to enter with your application</strong></li></ul>



<p>That may include the analysis of top charts and top categories. For example, if you have a game, it is completely logical to analyze such charts as top free games, top paid games, popular games, best new games, etc. In such a way, you will be able to determine what type is popular now in a particular niche and what trends may be followed.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1-1024x845.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6213" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1-1024x845.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1-300x248.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1-768x634.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1-740x611.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1.png 1322w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>As an example, let’s imagine that you have a development studio and would like to create an application, but you do not have any particular preferences in the niche; you just want to have an app in a popular category. Following the recommendations, you can just go to App Store and enter the chart “Popular apps”. On the screen, you may see an example that gives an understanding that now the most popular apps in the US AppStore are language and photo tools.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Analyze your competitors</strong></li></ul>



<p>If you have already decided which type of app you are going to develop, conduct a profound competitor analysis. This is needed both for visual and text optimization. The competitor&#8217;s analysis, as well as analysis of top-ranking apps in your category, will help you understand how they work with the app, update it and implement changes to the visuals, the lexical field, the keywords used, etc. It is important to do so to be in line with what users are expecting and how apps are positioned for this sector, so that you can identify good practice and implement it in your app or game.By the way, do not forget to use all the possible modern tools to analyze your niche and competitors, including AI.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1-1-1024x528.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6214" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1-1-1024x528.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1-1-300x155.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1-1-768x396.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1-1-1536x791.png 1536w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1-1-740x381.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-1-1.png 1780w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li><strong>Analyze trends in visual optimization</strong></li></ul>



<p>Of course, for different categories and types of apps/games, there may be different trends, but in most cases, if the app has a lot of competitors, it is easy to follow common trends used in visual optimization. I would like to show an example:&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the screenshot above, we tried to look for translation apps in the US and noticed a common thing that in most cases, all the developers are trying to use blue and dark blue in icon optimization (maybe that is connected with the colors used by the most popular translator by Google, which is known by most users and close to them). So basically, this may already be a trend in icon optimization. But it is even more clearly observed in countries that differ from the US and Europe, like Asia, and we will talk about this further. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06-1-1024x844.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6215" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06-1-1024x844.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06-1-300x247.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06-1-768x633.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06-1-740x610.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06-1.png 1322w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li><strong>Work with keyword cloud optimization on a permanent basis.</strong></li></ul>



<p>Add more and more search terms to your keyword list. In such a way, you will be able to follow all the changes in app positions as well as explore more new keywords with a good popularity score. Usually, the keyword for the app from the popular category may consist of 200-250 requests min.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Try to get as many keywords as possible by brainstorming, analyzing the competitors, and looking for suggestions on the store. By the way, with the last point, Keyapp ASO tools may help as well as any other services which have the functions of suggestions from GP or AP<br></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/07-1024x637.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6218" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/07-1024x637.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/07-300x187.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/07-768x478.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/07-740x461.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/07.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li><strong>Pay attention not only to the keywords with high popularity in your research.</strong></li></ul>



<p>When you use any ASO tool to check the keyword popularity and see high numbers, you believe that these keywords may only bring you organic traffic as they are used by users more often. That’s true, keywords with high popularity scores are used more often by users in the search for stores, but the competitiveness for them is higher as well, so it may be even more difficult to get into the index. Do not forget that long-tailed keywords of low popularity may bring users from the search as well, although occupying top ranks for such keywords is much more accessible both with ASO and keyword promotion. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="blob:https://keyapp.top/0265578d-3afc-41e1-bca9-bee73c9864be"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/08-1024x461.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6219" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/08-1024x461.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/08-300x135.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/08-768x346.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/08-740x333.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/08.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>All the processes conducted, both with keyword cloud and text optimization give the chance for the app to be indexed for keywords so as to be seen by organic users in the list of apps for search requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some tips for app localization: </p>



<ul><li>Treat localization as a separate optimization process. You should do keyword research for the target country, considering this is a completely new keyword cloud. Try to define exactly which keywords are popular in your vertical as well as try to get visibility on all the local keywords, not just do a blind translation of the texts you have created in English or in your native language.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/09-1024x335.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/09-1024x335.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6220" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/09-1024x335.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/09-300x98.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/09-768x252.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/09-740x242.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/09.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<ul><li>Localize the graphics for the local market as well. As for the graphic assets, remember that they are user-facing, so try to adapt all maps, calendars, and other elements that will make the users feel that this app has been developed correctly for them. The same may be applied to the characters you use on the screenshots/icon as with these screenshots, where for the US and Japan different models are used. Besides, it is important to translate all the phrases you have on icons, screenshots, or in promo videos to the local language as well. </li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10-1024x422.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6221" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10-1024x422.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10-300x124.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10-768x317.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10-740x305.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10.png 1322w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>App optimized for the US  /  The same app optimized for Japan</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>



<p>The App Store Optimization process is extremely important for your application&#8217;s success. Without an effective strategy, your application will remain unseen on the respective app stores you work with. At the same time, ASO influences not only the app visibility within the Google Play or AppStore but the app conversion and install rates as well. Summing up the main mistakes you may do as an app developer or marketer optimizing the application are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>You optimize the app blindly without creating any strategy</strong></li><li><strong>You do not work with a keyword cloud</strong></li><li><strong>You do work with localization (or just create the blind translation of the app texts)</strong></li><li><strong>You do not do iterations&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>You apply the same strategy to Google Play and AppStore</strong></li><li><strong>You rely only on organic position increases without using keyword promotion&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>Be attentive and apply all the possible tools to make your app visible and noticeable for organic users, and your application will surely reach success and a lot of organic traffic! </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>ASO is an application optimization that provides a variety of actions.</h2>
<p>keywords (specific words for which the user is looking for an application);<br />
descriptions (application description).<br />
In addition, it is possible to use only the visual components, as well as user ratings of applications and the total number of downloads.</p>
<p><img src="https://telegra.ph/file/d3c1ac0b9c1eab985b408.png" /></p>
<p>All this is necessary to increase the visibility of applications in a particular segment.</p>
<p>To ensure the diversity of the range and auditing audiences.</p>
<p>Apple and Google often change feature formats by trying new collections. But the main format is the promotional blocks: “Editor&#8217;s Choice” or “Recommended” when the user navigates to the application page in the store. All employees can manually and buy this service is impossible. Therefore, the ASO tools help transfer the maximum benefit.</p>
<p>Search promotion applications &#8211; step by step algorithm<br />
Like any promotion tool, ASO consists of a series of important sequential steps.</p>
<h2>STEP 1: TARGET AUDIENCE</h2>
<p>Only in 2017, the number of downloads mobile applications in the world reached 26 billion, an increase of 8%. Russia is in fifth place in the <a href="https://aso.keyapp.top/">ranking of application</a> downloads. The Russians made 3.8 billion downloads of applications on Google Play and the App Store for the year.</p>
<p>For this you need to make all the necessary efforts. To find an application to search the search engine.</p>
<p>You need to understand that you have a hobby, related interests, and how your application can help him.</p>
<p>User Segments</p>
<p>geography;<br />
device platform (iOS, Android);<br />
social and demographic indicators (gender, age);<br />
user types;<br />
interests<br />
solvency;<br />
In line with the interests of Russian users, games, business applications and entertainment are leading.</p>
<h2>STEP 2: COLLECTING SEMANTICS</h2>
<p>Keywords can have:</p>
<p>enough frequency;<br />
average frequency;<br />
low frequency<br />
Queries on demand can be tested in current user applications &#8211; this will help to think big when forming queries.</p>
<p>Experienced optimizers for collecting semantics use several services at once, including AppCodes, Appunique, MobileDevHQ, as well as uploading keywords from Wordstat.yandex.ru, Google AdWords, Google Keyword Planner, Google Trends, to get a list of keys and phrases as accurately as possible describing a particular application.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cossa.ru/upload/medialibrary/71d/image2.png" /></p>
<p>The collection of requests in which you need to meet a variety of requirements. This procedure can be performed manually or using ASO Tools or Rush-analytics tools with upload to Google Sheets.</p>
<h2>STEP 3: AUDIT OF THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE APP</h2>
<p>If you have the opportunity to work not only immediately, then before the search promotion begins, it is important that the application is in demand from the audience:</p>
<p>how many downloads;<br />
how many views;<br />
the application is not below the top 20;<br />
whether there are user reviews, what is the reputation of applications among the audience.<br />
This will help to put the “A” point and correctly predict what results and within what time frame can be achieved with the help of the ASO, that is, put the “B” point and plan for achieving it with fixing intermediate stages.</p>
<h2>STEP4: ANALYSIS OF COMPETITORS</h2>
<p>When <a href="https://aso.keyapp.top/">searching for promotion of applications</a>, one should take into account the competitiveness of the market, for example, in order to promote games, keys should be selected pointwise among low-frequency queries of several words.</p>
<p>It is important to look at the descriptions of related applications and what words they are promoting. Such services as searchman.com and suggest &amp; search can help track competitor requests.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cossa.ru/upload/medialibrary/ae1/image7.jpg" /></p>
<p>This will help not only to evaluate the descriptions and learn the strengths and weaknesses of other applications, but also to differ as much as possible from others, both visually and in the texts of the descriptions.</p>
<h2>STEP 5: SELECTING THE EXACT OPTIMIZED TITLE</h2>
<p>The first thing that introduces a potential user of the application to the search bar in the stores is the name or those words that should be reflected in the name of the application. Therefore, when choosing the name of the application, it makes sense to use exact occurrences of keywords.</p>
<p>It is important to take into account the requirements of the applications to the name. In the App Store, the allowed length of the name is 50 characters, but the visible part is up to 30 characters, the rest is cut off. On Google Play, the name is immediately limited to 30 characters, including the visible part in the catalog.</p>
<p>The name is one of the key ranking factors, so priority requests should be placed at the beginning.</p>
<p>So, thanks to the replacement of the name and the introduction of key queries into it, the growth in the number of downloads was achieved by 5%, and the visibility of the application in search increased by 13.5%.</p>
<h2>STEP 6: CREATING A DESCRIPTION UNDER KEY REQUESTS</h2>
<p>When the semantics is collected, the name of the application is determined and tested, you need to fill in the meta tags and determine from the entire assembled semantic core 10 basic queries by which the application can break into the top story.</p>
<p>In the description of the application, it is important to note that this should not be just a text, stuffed with keywords, but a text that most accurately and clearly reflects the utility of the application for the end user, and from the very first lines. Moreover, the description is not indexed by keys in the App Store.</p>
<p>In Googe Play, on the contrary, the description plays the main role in indexing, and according to the rules of classic SEO. The number of occurrences of keywords per number of characters in the text is important. The description on Google Play is divided into short &#8211; up to 80 characters and a full description of up to 4 thousand characters. The main key requests and the essence of the application need to fit into the first 80 characters.</p>
<p>But the requirements for clarity and attractiveness to the consumer are the same for all sites.</p>
<p>Also on Google Play there is a separate Keywords field, where 100 characters are given for making key requests.</p>
<h2>STEP 7: CREATING ATTRACTIVE ICONS AND SCREENSHOTS</h2>
<p>Choosing an application in the search, the first thing you notice is the icon, how much it stands out and answers the given topic. There are several key recommendations for the design of the icon:</p>
<p>Do not add text to them &#8211; there is a name for this;<br />
avoid background transparency and small elements;<br />
Do not use photos or screenshots as an icon.<br />
When developing an icon, it is necessary to take into account the visual range of competitors, since the one who is brighter and more attractive wins in the catalog. Test and choose what causes the greatest response of users and most reflects the essence of the application. Color, gradient, image quality and even line thickness can influence the choice.</p>
<p>Informative screenshots</p>
<p>Properly designed block with screenshots increases the conversion to the installation. In the screenshot, the user sees the application screen with the device framing and a short description of the functions on the screen.</p>
<h2>STEP 8: WORK WITH TIPS</h2>
<p>Reviews of the application have a lot of weight, so you need to motivate users to leave them, offer to evaluate the application. When reviews are negative, they need to be worked out, especially since you can respond to them on Google Play, and starting with version iOS 10.3 &#8211; and in the App Store. So high the probability that the user will correct his assessment and will be more loyal to the developer.</p>
<p>ASO is an effective, relatively inexpensive and long-playing way to bring mobile applications to the top search engines in the store and natural growth of organic coverage. But the effect of search engine promotion is not fast and requires constant work and testing under the conditions of changing algorithms and user requirements.</p>
<p>Hope this was helpful!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>WHAT ARE KEYWORDS?</h2>
<p>Keywords are words, phrases that define the content of a specific page, and also this is a search query that a user enters in a search engine, for example in Google Play.</p>
<p>For example, you are looking for a travel app. This text entered in the search engine, and there are keywords. The webmaster who promotes this query should optimize the page correctly. That is, the word “travel” must be spelled out in the description or name a certain number of times, the names of the pictures must be spelled with this key, it must be “diluted”, used in a direct and not direct occurrence.</p>
<h2>WHY DO WE NEED KEYWORDS  IN THE TEXT?</h2>
<p>Keywords are used in the text in order to increase the relevance of the page, and as a result &#8211; to promote it in search results. Of course, there are a lot of other factors affecting positions in search engines (inbound links, behavioral factors, domain age, resource attendance, trust, and much more), but keywords, basic page optimization are not unimportant.</p>
<h2>WHAT SHOULD BE THE NUMBER OF KEYWORDS?</h2>
<p>Depending on the volume of the text, it must have a different number of keys. Dependence is directly proportional. For example, in the text of the size of 2000-3000 characters, it is enough to use 2-3 key phrases.</p>
<p>Another tip is to look at successful competitors. If their applications by your requests are in the TOP, then the texts like search engines. Estimate the number of occurrences of a specific keyword on the competitive application page, how long the text is. In order not to sit for hours on this job, you can connect to the work of an optimizer assistant — free <a href="https://aso.keyapp.top/">ASO services</a> or purchase a keyword selection service from the services that do it. First you will find the right words for your application, and then with the tool &#8220;Competitor Analysis&#8221; you will conduct a study and get the necessary data on competitors in just a few minutes.</p>
<p><img src="https://telegra.ph/file/196692e02fff6c0185510.png" /></p>
<h2>WHAT SHOULD BE THE TEXT WITH KEYWORDS?</h2>
<p>People do not like spam text with many keywords. By the way, the search engines do not like this content. If earlier such texts ranked well, today there are completely different factors in the price, not the number of keys on the page. The number of keys in the text is determined by its &#8220;nausea.&#8221; Nausea is calculated based on the occurrence of each word in the text. &#8220;The percentage of nausea&#8221; should not exceed 3-5 percent. Typically, customers of texts for ASO, specify this parameter. A little advice: check your writing after writing.</p>
<h2>HOW NOT TO GET KEYWORDS?</h2>
<p>When there are a lot of keywords, they need to be used a large number of times &#8211; glue them together.</p>
<p>Example: the last query contains all the above keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>? How to promote the application;</li>
<li>? how to promote the application for free;</li>
<li>? how to promote the application yourself;</li>
<li>? how to promote the application free;</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, there is no need to use each key phrase separately. This &#8220;nesting&#8221; provides better readability of texts.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE KEYWORDS?</h2>
<p>Before you write the text, make its plan, think over the structure. Then it will be much nicer to cope with the task:</p>
<ul>
<li>? Try to avoid inserting keywords in places where they do not fit in the meaning;</li>
<li>? Do not write paragraphs specifically to insert 1-2 keys;</li>
<li>? If possible, glue, dilute the keys, it will make the work more readable, more natural to the user&#8217;s eyes;</li>
<li>? Remember that people read the content, not the search robots, your texts should be organic, readable, and the keywords in them should be invisible.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We can’t stop talking about ASO…</p>
<p>Because it’s so important, people!</p>
<p>App store optimization is essential for getting a higher rank for your mobile application in the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>Getting a higher rank in app store rankings is crucial to increasing your apps’ userbase, and it can skyrocket your downloads and revenue generated from your app.</p>
<p>Okay, so here we are giving you the best 5 aso tips for your android app. Ready?</p>
<p><b>1.Use Keywords in Your App Title and in the first sentence of your description. </b></p>
<p>These are the most important areas to put your keywords in, the algorithm will look at them first thing.</p>
<p>2.<b>Localize Your App!</b></p>
<p>Get your stats! Where the most of your users come from?</p>
<p>The majority of mobile devices are nowadays used in non-English speaking countries, and these countries also generate most of the revenue for mobile apps. So, it’s a good idea to localize your app content to meet the requirements of your target user base.</p>
<p><b>3.Don’t use too many keywords in the description</b></p>
<p>You must also be mindful not to overdo this as several amateur developers make the mistake of using too many keywords which may lead to lower rankings as such behavior is considered keyword stuffing. A single keyword must not be used more than 5 times in an app store product page.</p>
<p>The goal is not to game the system but to strike a balance between a description favored by the algorithm and a clear written description that will catch the attention of a user.</p>
<p><b>4.Have a Preview Video</b></p>
<p>Catch users’ attention from the first glance! Apps that have  a video preview have more chances to get downloaded!</p>
<p><b>5.Know your Customer and Competition</b></p>
<p>You must study your customers and competitors and create targeted marketing content to reach your target audience. You must be able to answer the following questions even before you start the ASO process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are your real customers? Where do they live and what language do, they speak?</li>
<li>How do they describe your app?</li>
<li>What is your competitive advantage over other similar apps?</li>
<li>Track keywords targeted by your competitors?</li>
</ul>
<p>You must try to put yourself in your customer’s shoes and strive to deliver your best. You can also learn a lot about your customers by interacting with them or reading the reviews of your app left by them as customers often vent out their issues in the review section of an app.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get to the TOP and stay there is becoming more and more difficult because of the fact that the application market is growing by leaps and bounds. As an application developer, what do you come across at the very beginning? If you create an app on a topic that is very popular, do you think you will get proper attention to your product without any effort?</span></p>
<p><b>WHY DO YOU NEED TO WORK ON YOUR APP?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each developer at first counts on the fact that as soon as the application will see the light, it immediately will be in the TOP and break the application stores. </span><b>This is certainly possible, but for this, there must be an impeccable concept, something innovative, something that will explore the world of applications.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Let&#8217;s face it, not everyone succeeds, and therefore, we need to work on our app and the strategy for its promotion.</span></p>
<p><b>So, you probably already heard about ASO?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Let&#8217;s start with what it is and why it is very important for your app.</span></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS ASO?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASO (App Store Optimization) is a set of measures to optimize your app: title, keywords, descriptions, in order to maximize the visibility of your app in the market.</span></p>
<p><b>Let&#8217;s consider the checklist of optimization:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keywords optimization;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Description optimization;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title optimization;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visual app design;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indicators of the app;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>A few mandatory actions for the maximum result of the application promotion using ASO:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the most effective and most inefficient of the keywords queries;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyze the categories to which your app can be related;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience competitors;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimize the name of the application, relying on the TOPs;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select the most accurate keywords for queries;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a cool visual application series (screenshots, uncommon design);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create (if necessary) and optimize the promo video;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localization of the application (if required);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular application upgrade;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyze user ratings and reviews;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regularly analyze and select the most optimal keywords;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both app markets, people are constantly looking for new apps in the search engine. This means that if there is no competent keyword request &#8211; there is no promotion and organic.</span></p>
<p><b>ASO LIFEHACKS</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After analyzing the semantic kernel, put the most popular keyword in the app’s name. </span><b>So your app will always be at the forefront.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to go to the TOP and get as much attention to your app as possible &#8211; write the request in a special way. </span><b>For Google Play, a phrase written in bold or underlined font will work much more productively, attracting more attention.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Please pay special attention to the first screen of your app.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is an important detail, waving a hand on which, you will spoil the impression of the application as a whole.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you generate keywords queries, work through several options for keys:</span></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Keywords are unique not only for your app.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You need to conduct analytics to check how often your app is requested for your competitors;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible to analyze the most popular keywords of your competitors;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constantly improve your app, conduct analytics, optimize keywords, watch the trends of the mobile app market.</span></li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The competition in App stores is huge. When a new trend or idea appears, chances are a lot of apps already use it. So how do you make your own app stand out?</p>
<p>ASO or App Store Optimisation is the process of optimizing an app in order to increase its number of downloads. But how do you do that?</p>
<p>Here is your 2018 ASO checklist for Google Play Store:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Title: the title can be up to 50 characters. The keywords used in the title are also indexed by the Google algorithm.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Short description: you can add some keywords to it but it&#8217;s not as important as in the title or long app description.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Long description: Use long-tail keywords, include your main hight-competition keywords. Repeat them 3-4 times (not more than 5 times if the description is long). Keep in mind that your sentences should still make sense and be pleasant to read (don’t stuff keywords everywhere just to reach the ideal density).</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Screenshots, app icon, promo video : The general goal is to focus on high quality &amp; simple design in line with your app’s visual identity. It’s highly advised to use high-quality screenshots of your apps with short sentences to explain the features. Videos should be short, with zero narration/sound (they’ll be muted so since you can’t rely on voice to explain, focus on something else).</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Rating &amp; reviews : good rating &amp; reviews improve conversion because users are more likely to download well-rated apps, and a high conversion has a positive influence in your ranking position.<br />
Finally, bear in mind that the app ecosystem is dynamic : it’s constantly evolving. Adapt by watching what your competitors are doing, following trends and seasonality and updating your app’s version and metadata regularly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Store metadata refinement is the first thing that comes to mind of mobile publishers once they hear about <strong>App Store Optimization (ASO)</strong>. For sure, keywords, app name, subtitles, etc. are extremely important for app’s discoverability in the stores. Yet, smart marketers know that the impact of text elements by no means downplays the importance of product page visuals, especially when it comes to conversion growth.</p>
<p>After all, thousands of SplitMetrics tests have proven that less than 2% of app store visitors tap on “read more” button. Indeed, we tend to neglect extensive texts in favor of visual information, our behaviour in the major app stores is no exception.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration that screenshots take a substantial part of store product pages, they tend to draw a large proportion of uses’ attention. That’s why polishing of screenshots has more potential of skyrocketing your app’s conversion than other store page elements.</p>
<p>However, there’s no use applying random screenshot changes in the app stores and waiting for phenomenal results straight away. The truth is, you never know what will work and what will deteriorate your app’s performance. That’s why A/B testing is a must when it comes to ASO.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.apptweak.com/blog/images/ab-testing-1.png" alt="ab-testing-1.png.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Image Source: <a href="https://splitmetrics.com/resources/what-is-ab-testing-and-why-it-matters-for-mobile-developers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SplitMetrics</a></em></p>
<p><strong>A/B testing</strong> or <strong>Split-testing</strong> is a method of hypothesis checking. Two variations are compared in the course of such tests and the results help to identify an option with the best performance. On one hand, easy mechanisms stand behind A/B testing, on the other hand, the process isn’t as straightforward as it may seem.</p>
<p>Once you decided to use A/B testing to perfect your screenshots, you should take all of the following steps to ensure trustworthy results which will really make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Here are core ingredients of any quality A/B testing strategy:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>analysis and variations brainstorming;</li>
<li>designing of screenshots;</li>
<li>running your A/B experiment;</li>
<li>evaluation of results;</li>
<li>results implementation and follow-up experiments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s dwell on each step of this never-failing A/B testing strategy.</p>
<h2>Pre-A/B Testing Analysis and Variations Brainstorming</h2>
<p>The first thing you should remember is that any A/B testing activity is doomed if it doesn’t rely on a solid hypothesis. Split-tests for the sake of split-tests make no sense. So first of all, you should come up with a screenshot idea worth proving.</p>
<p>Wonder where to take such idea? The answer is simple &#8211; research. Treat major app stores as show windows and determine best screenshot practices in your app category and the stores in general. It goes without saying that above all you should look up to the industry leaders.</p>
<p>At identifying the latest trends concerning screenshots in the app stores, it’s time to prioritize ideas and elaborate hypothesis for testing. Think how you can reflect <a href="https://splitmetrics.com/blog/app-store-screenshots-aso-guide/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">best app store screenshot practices</a>. Here are a few assumptions worth testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>My app will get more installs if I change the <a href="https://splitmetrics.com/blog/angry-birds-2-as-a-case-study-for-aso-and-ab-testing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">orientation of the screenshots</a>. For instance, Rovio tested vertical screenshots against horizontal ones. As a result, portrait orientation won and the conversion rate of Angry Birds 2 increased by 13%;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Users will install my app more often if the screenshots will highlight value and benefits not merely app’s features;</li>
<li>Using all available screenshots will favour my app’s conversion;</li>
<li>The usage of social proof (testimonials, media mentions, and awards) will make my app more appealing for app store visitors;</li>
<li>My app’s conversion will grow if I reflect my app’s latest feature in the first screenshot.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.apptweak.com/blog/images/ab-testing-3.png" alt="ab-testing-3.png" /></p>
<p><em>Image Source: <a href="https://apple.com/itunes" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple</a></em></p>
<p>Studying competitors’ product pages is definitely not enough. You should have a clear vision of the market. Profound analysis of your target audience is another success ingredient of your A/B testing. You should know your ideal users: their age, sex, interests, etc. Qualification of traffic sources is another important activity within this analysis stage.</p>
<p>This step also involves goals setting and choosing the experiment type which you plan to launch. It may be screenshots testing on your product page or in the context of the search results and category search. The first experiment type will help to boost overall conversion of your product page, while the latter will show how your screenshots perform next to competitors.</p>
<h2>Variations Creation</h2>
<p>Well done! Now you have a couple of hypothesis to test. It’s high time to implement these ideas in actual screenshots.</p>
<p>For instance, ZiMAD decided to <a href="https://splitmetrics.com/blog/designing-screenshots-a-guide-on-how-to-achieve-a-32-conversion-lift/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">test redesigned screenshots</a> for the game Bubble Birds 4. New screenshots reflected classic game screenshots layout: main character in the front of the image, gameplay background, powerful caption which highlights features.</p>
<p>The company wanted to test if the game category best practice will increase the converting power of their product page. Yet, they were not that straightforward with ‘gameplay background’: their new background encapsulated art overlays, real screenshots, and gameplay elements. As a result, new version got a 32% lift in conversion.</p>

<p>If you plan to use a simple pattern in your screenshots (solid background and device), you can do without a designer, as there are loads of screenshot builders to help you with it.</p>

<p>However, if you plan to apply something more creative (сonnected or splash screen screenshots), professional designer skills are a must.</p>

<h2>Running A/B Experiments</h2>
<p>First of all, you should choose a tool for A/B testing. You can consider <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6227309?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Play Experiments</a> providing you have only Android apps. Facebook ads is another option as you can test various screenshots within ad banners.</p>
<p>Another alternative is <a href="https://splitmetrics.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SplitMetrics</a>, it’s an all-in-one split-testing platform which helps you to run experiments for both iOS and Android apps. Moreover, it makes pre-launch experiments possible.</p>
<p>No matter what platform you choose, your experiment should comply with the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variations should look like store pages to make users behave naturally;</li>
<li>Traffic should be divided equally between variations;</li>
<li>Test only one hypothesis during one test;</li>
<li>Your experiment should be filled with enough traffic to reach statistically significant results (this amount depends on app’s conversion rate and traffic quality: the higher conversion, the less users you need);</li>
<li>Remember to utilize traffic source and targeting you revealed during the analysis stage;</li>
<li>It makes sense to run an A/B test for a week to register user behaviour on different weekdays.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Results Evaluation</h2>
<p>Here goes the favorite part of most publishers &#8211; results evaluation. It’s the moment of truth when you find out whether your hypothesis was right or wrong. Results may be evident or ambiguous, your redesigned screenshots might beat control version or trigger conversion decrease.</p>
<p>One way or another, it’s vital to keep in mind that there is no such thing as negative results when it comes to A/B testing. Even if your beloved freshly designed screenshot set doesn’t perform that well, it’s still the result, which prevented careless changes on your product page and further conversion decline.</p>
<p>For instance, Mallzee ran a series of <a href="https://splitmetrics.com/blog/app-ab-testing-negative-results/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A/B tests</a> and the overwhelming majority of their assumptions were proven wrong. However, this seemingly disastrous outcome prevented the company from the conversion fall by 25%. The case demonstrates once again that testing is a must and there’s no place for guessing in ASO.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.apptweak.com/blog/images/ab-testing-7.png" alt="ab-testing-7.png" /></p>
<p><em>Image Source: <a href="https://splitmetrics.com/blog/app-ab-testing-negative-results/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SplitMetrics</a></em></p>
<p>On this step, providing you use advanced A/B testing tools, you can learn and analyze how store visitors interact with your product page before installing the app. Such metrics as interaction funnel, time on page, scroll heatmaps, etc. will help you understand your target users better and therefore polish your marketing strategy.</p>
<h2>Results Implementation and Follow-Up Experiments</h2>
<p>You have two options on this stage:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have an apparent winner variation, you can implement changed screenshots in the app store straight away;</li>
<li>You can use the results of your A/B experiments in further testing.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may ask, “Why should I waste my time on follow-up tests if I’m pretty satisfied with the results of initial testing?” First of all, congratulation on successful A/B testing. Secondly, there’s still a lot to be done unless your conversion is 100% and it’s nearly impossible.</p>
<p>The truth is, great apps keep their top positions because they never stop developing the product and optimize all the elements that can influence conversion. Let’s take Prisma, the app which was named among the best applications of 2016 according to Apple. Prisma ran a series of tests to <a href="https://splitmetrics.com/cases/prisma-optimizes-app-store-images/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">optimize screenshots</a>, they resulted in impressive 12.3% lift in conversion.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.apptweak.com/blog/images/ab-testing-8.png" alt="ab-testing-8.png" /></p>
<p><em>Image Source: <a href="https://splitmetrics.com/cases/prisma-optimizes-app-store-images/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SplitMetrics</a></em></p>
<p>Considering viral popularity of the app, this increase meant thousands of extra downloads every day. Nevertheless, the team didn’t stop and kept playing around different screenshots.</p>
<p>These experiments took the increase of conversion even further, it reached 19.7% eventually. It proves one more time that there’s always a room for improvement.</p>

<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>Every app publisher has to understand that App Store Optimization is an ongoing process, a single A/B test for screenshots will barely make a difference. This <a href="https://splitmetrics.com/free-aso-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ASO checklist</a> can help you to get your bearings, once you get down to app store optimization. You can also check AppTweak’s <a href="https://www.apptweak.com/aso-blog/the-ultimate-app-store-optimization-aso-cheat-sheet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ultimate ASO Checklist</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that iOS and Android users behave differently in the stores. No matter how tempting it is, never apply results of, let’s say, experiments on Apple App Store to your product page in Google Play. It may result in major conversion decline.</p>
<p>If you are determined to change the conversion of your product page for better, it’s vital to arm yourself with patience and sense of purpose. Keep moving beyond and keep experimenting with your screenshot layouts to scale results. Good luck!</p>
