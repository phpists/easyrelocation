<p id="xUZliYn">Last week, Samsung began to distribute the final stable update with the Android 9 Pie operating system for Galaxy Note8 smartphones. Coverage has expanded to several additional regions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galaxy Note8 users in Russia, Iran, India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and some other Asian countries have started reporting on the possible download of Android 9 Pie to a smartphone. The firmware includes the February Android security update.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Samsung, this is all you need to upgrade. At the moment, Android 9 Pie for Samsung Galaxy Note8 is already available in more than ten countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also expected to be an update for the Samsung Galaxy S8, which will be released no earlier than March of this year.</span></p>
<p><strong>ANDROID USERS GET MORE FREEDOM</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://telegra.ph/file/c0b670cc86f0d73284d2f.png" /></p>
<p id="ISDrtfl">Google has changed its policy regarding users that don’t like using the Google Play Store.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of Google is t remove the restriction on downloading updates for already installed games and programs from Google Play for unauthorized users. However, if the user decides to exit the app store, he needs more updates, but the new initiative allows downloading applications for programs even without entering usernames and passwords. This option is available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is just in words. The hardest thing that may seem at first glance. This is a confirmation that Google may create errors or errors. It is recommended to contact Google directly with a detailed description of the problems found. This option should appear on Android devices soon.</span></p>
<p><strong>GOOGLE CHROME FOR ANDROID RADICALLY CHANGED</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://telegra.ph/file/d07a86dcba14be9691736.png" /></p>
<p id="GOBrfFh">One of Google’s key products is the Chrome web browser, which is getting better and better every year. Hundreds of developers on an ongoing basis do everything in order to offer the best user experience, a reliable security system, a sufficient number of different possibilities, as well as a fast download speed of sites. Today, February 18, 2019, the release of the new Google Chrome for Android took place, which everyone can already install, but so far in the test version.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, immediately after installation, you can easily notice that the web browser for mobile devices based on the Android operating system has changed radically, and soon the same innovations are most likely waiting for users of mobile devices based on iOS. Previously, the list of open tabs was located in a vertical form, with the result that only the top of all websites was visible, now the contributions look like small miniatures, and most of one page or another page is visible on them.</span></p>
<p><strong>NEW <a href="https://youtu.be/4HJhBUIVul8" data-rel="lightbox-video-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EMOJI KIT </a>PRESENTED</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unicode Consortium announced 230 new Emoji, which appeared on mobile devices and computers in 2019. Among them, there are very unusual ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the set of new Emoji, you can see children, flags, waffles, a person in a wheelchair, a Hindu temple, juice boxes, gay couples, a memorial at the bottom and much more. Some Emoji repeat each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These applications will be added to Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and other operating systems in a few months &#8211; with major platform updates.</span></p>
<p><strong>THE VERY FIRST BROWSER IS LAUNCHED AGAIN</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://telegra.ph/file/729273a0816af2b5d0e65.png" /></p>
<p id="gqFJtKJ">The European Organization for Nuclear Research released the web version of the very first WorldWideWeb magazine, created by the founder of the Internet in December 1990.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no usual address bar in this browser. Document&gt; Open from full document, write page address and click Open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No video, sounds, or graphics but only text. Multimedia elements began to appear on the Internet only in 1992. Burns-Lee developed this program on the NeXT computer that did not support color monitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of the WorldWideWeb web emulator is timed to the 30th anniversary of the first magazine. On the CERN website, you can also find screenshots of the first sites made by Burns-Lee in the nineties and links to articles on the most important events affecting the development of the Internet.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rivalry between the two most successful companies is what is really interesting. So, now we will reveal 5 advantages of Android.</p>
<p>1. DIVERSITY AND AVAILABILITY<br />
Thanks to the openness and availability of Android, the market presents a huge number of models running this OS, which will suit customers with any requests. The diversity is not comparable to the iPhone, which is produced by one company. Freedom of choice is one of the main advantages of Android-based devices that no other existing mobile OS can boast of.</p>
<p>2. PERSONALIZATION AND SETTINGS FLEXIBILITY<br />
The variety of Android-devices is perfectly complemented by almost the same number of different styles of design for smartphones and tablets on this platform. In the iPhone, the biggest thing you can do to change the appearance of the interface is to change the wallpaper and add widgets to the lock screen. And that&#8217;s all. This is not in any comparison with the customization of the Android. On the Internet, thousands of different buttons, fonts, icons and whole themes are available, completely changing the look of Android. If you so wish, you can update your smartphone at least every day for a year, without ever having to repeat it.</p>
<p>3. FULL ACCESS TO THE FILE SYSTEM<br />
Even the fans and ardent apologists of the Apple platform often with horror remember the need to use iTunes in order to throw music from your computer onto your smartphone. Especially strongly from the congestion and complexity of iTunes suffer owners of Windows-computers. In Android, there is no hint of such problems. The device can be connected to any computer and work as a USB flash drive. Moreover, many Android-smartphones can connect a variety of peripheral devices through the OTG-cable, from mice and keyboards to storage devices.</p>
<p>4. PIRACY<br />
Almost any program can be installed on the Android-device absolutely free of charge, even if on Google Play for it ask at least one dollar, even one hundred. For this, almost nobody movements are necessary. It&#8217;s enough to tick the settings and register on one of the many resources with a compromised software. All &#8211; welcome to the world of free pirated content. In iOS, there is also the ability to install such applications by resorting to jailbreaking, but this is due to incommensurably greater difficulties.</p>
<p>5. PROGRAM FISHES<br />
As in iOS, and Android has its own software fished. In the OS from Google, you can put them anywhere on the desktop and get the actual update without unnecessary movements. The same weather forecast the user will see as soon as he looks at the screen. Multitasking in Android and iOS is implemented in different ways, with its pros and cons. Nevertheless, Google offers a more convenient and familiar for computer users system. Let it badly affects the battery life of the device, but it offers honest multitasking.</p>
<p>If you could unequivocally say that one OS is better than another, there would be only one, the best platform in the world. However, users still have a choice. Based on the needs, tasks, financial opportunities and personal sympathies, everyone is able to choose on their own, without prompts, what is to his liking. And iOS and Android are evolving, improving, growing and, what&#8217;s too much to say, become similar to each other. One thing is obvious &#8211; both operating systems are worth living and from version to version are getting better.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past two years, the whole world has witnessed how state security agencies monitor the owners of mobile devices. Against this background, Apple has strengthened the security of the operating system iOS, thereby making the iPhone and iPad unattainable not only for law enforcement agencies but for intruders who want to hack them. If a six-digit PIN is set to the &#8220;apple&#8221; device, then no one will ever be able <span class="text_exposed_show">to access the content, since it is securely encrypted.</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>Alas, but Google, and with it, all mobile device manufacturers, do not care much about the security of user data on smart-phones running the Android operating system. Moreover, none of the major companies like Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, Sony, and others, does even warn users that all information from their smart-phones can be easily extracted from the mobile device and used for any purpose.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Google still added to the Android operating system a special function that will make any smart-phone &#8220;impenetrable&#8221; for hacking .Whether specifically, or not, but it was hidden in the settings so far that the average user is unlikely could find it and pay some attention to it. A hidden function in the OS allows you to encrypt all the information stored on Android-smart-phones, making it completely protected.</p>
<p>In order to encrypt the device, you need to open the Settings application and follow the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; path &#8211; &#8220;Privacy&#8221;. Here. almost at the very bottom, there is a section called &#8220;Encrypt the device,&#8221; which is required to be opened. Google warns that protecting data on an Android smart-phone with this function may slightly reduce its performance, and also deprive some of the features and capabilities, like an auto-switching alarm at the time when the device is turned off.</p>
<p>When you encrypt a mobile device, you will need to enter a PIN or password, which you will need to enter each time after the smart-phone restarts. If it is forgotten or lost, it will be impossible to recover the data stored on the Android device. Rather, they can be extracted, but because they are encrypted, nobody can read them. This is the most reliable way to protect data on smart phones and tablets running any version of the Android operating system</p>
