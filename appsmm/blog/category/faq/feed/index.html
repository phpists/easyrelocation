<p>How to use app store connect which section it has and actually how it can help you in your app performance analysis and the main source of data. After entering App Store connect you get to the main page where different sections are:</p>



<ul>

<li><a href="#apps"><u>My Apps</u></a></li>

<li><a href="#analytics"><u>App Analytics</u></a> </li>

<li><a href="#sales"><u>Sales and Trends</u></a></li>
</ul>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="apps"><strong>My Apps Section</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01-3.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01-3-1024x485.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6034" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01-3-1024x485.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01-3-300x142.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01-3-768x364.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01-3-740x350.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01-3.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>The first section we go to is <strong>“My apps”</strong> where you will see all the applications you have published in your developer account as well as you will be able to add a new application or a new bundle for the application which is already published on the App Store. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02-3.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02-3-1024x538.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6035" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02-3-1024x538.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02-3-300x158.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02-3-768x404.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02-3-570x300.png 570w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02-3-740x389.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02-3.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>When we enter the in particular application the first information we see is some general information about the application and about the current version of the application. Here you can actually add the new version for your app. So as you may see here are the screenshots they actually are displayed for the country the app is localized for. Here you can change it if the application is localized for any other regions. As you may see different types and different sizes of screenshots are required by the App Store to be published for your application, like for different sizes of iPhones and for different sizes of iPads.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03-3.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03-4-1024x485.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6042" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03-4-1024x485.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03-4-300x142.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03-4-768x364.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03-4-740x350.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03-4.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>Promotional text</strong> which will be displayed about the description of your application and will inform the visitors of your application of any current app features.</p>



<p><strong>Description</strong> it is like similar on Google Play but we remember the difference in ASO &#8211;  that description on app store isn&#8217;t indexed and actually you could use the description only as a way to describe your application and the functionality it has but there is no sense in adding the keywords to the description text </p>



<p><strong>What&#8217;s new in this version? </strong>For each version of your application which you add you need to add to the section which is called “what&#8217;s new” and actually mention the changes you have made.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/04-2.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/04-3-1024x481.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6043" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/04-3-1024x481.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/04-3-300x141.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/04-3-768x361.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/04-3-740x348.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/04-3.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>Keywords. </strong>It is one of the most important fields which is not seen to organic users and this thing only in app store connect but anyway here you should add all the keywords connected with your application to make the application findable by organic users in this search actually. Remember that the maximum number of symbols here is 100 and actually all the keywords should be divided by comma and there is no sense in repeating the same keywords.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05-2.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-4" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05-3-1024x479.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6044" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05-3-1024x479.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05-3-300x140.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05-3-768x359.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05-3-740x346.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05-3.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>App review information</strong> which should be filled to give Apple the chance to contact you while they review the application. It is also important to remember that it is needed to provide a username and password so Apple could sign into your application to complete the review.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06-2.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-5" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img src="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06-2-1024x480.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6039" srcset="https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06-2-1024x480.png 1024w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06-2-300x141.png 300w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06-2-768x360.png 768w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06-2-740x347.png 740w, https://keyapp.top/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06-2.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>App information </strong>and it already consists of the app name, the title and subtitle, two text assets which are extremely important for the indexation process on the App Store. So here you can change the country as well and for each country you can add its own localized version. Here are some general information about your application like bundle ID, primary language, category which can be chosen so all the information about your application next</p>

<p><strong>iOS App Ratings &amp; reviews.</strong> On this page you work with app reputation and with feedback your application receives. Remember both ratings and reviews are divided on App Store depending on the region so here you can choose all countries to see all the reviews or you may choose some particular region you would like to check the rating and reviews for. There are also some filters and you may check the reviews for particular app version, you may check the particular reviews connected with stores and of course you may see the reviews with developer responses without them or the reviews which were actually edited by the users </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Unfortunately, there is no official data you may use to analyze this information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>First of all, you can check this information only for your own application in the Google Play developer console, so when you enter the application and go to conversion analysis, you can actually check for which keywords your application gets the highest number of downloads in the particular country. So this can actually help you, for example, in keyword promotion. If you see that the application is getting high volumes for a particular keyword and you understand that the position for this keyword is not top one but top 10, for example, you can use these keywords in keyword promotion campaigns to boost the ranks to top positions, and in such a way the amount of organic search traffic may even increase and become higher due to the fact that the application is occupying top one for now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when we are talking about the App Store, there is no way to check for which keywords your application is getting traffic, even in App Store Connect for your own application. First of all, you need to conduct competitor research. Let&#8217;s imagine that you have drifting application, so you just put the main keyword like “drifting”&nbsp; and actually analyzes all apps in search. It is needed for you to understand for which keywords each of these applications is in position one, or at least in position three if it is a game. So you can go, for example, to <a href="https://keyapp.top/">Keyapp</a>, use “Smart campaign,” and check all the apps for the indexed keywords. In such a way, you will know which keywords occupy the top ranks. So probably the applications are getting the search traffic exactly for these requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One more method is to analyze the text, such as to see which keywords are added to the title and short description, as these two fields are the most important and most probably the most trafficked keywords will be added there for some competitor apps. And you can use different app store optimization services that actually do the same thing but just show you the analyzed data. Pay attention to the fact that all this data is just assumptions because official information from both stores is unfortunately not possible to get.</p>

<p>The keywords are quite different, and the process of keyword promotion for different keywords is different as well,as are the results you may get. If you want to keep the position, it is necessary to set up the campaign even after you reach the top. The first step we need to do is evaluate for how many days it will be okay to set up the supporting campaign for the rank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So usually for Google Play, it is okay to set four- five- seven days and then check out the keyword behavior to see if there have been any changes in the rank. If we talk about the daily volume to use to keep the position, we recommend to continue campaign with approximately the same amount you have used for at least three to four days. And if you see that the rank doesn&#8217;t change, you can start to decrease this daily volume by 20-30% like once every two or three days. In this way, you will help the application stay at the top, because we understand that after the application achieves a particular rank, it is not certain that at once the organic downloads from the search will appear. It is needed to understand that for Google, it is needed some time to update the rank on all the device types for all the users, so organic downloads from the search may not appear at once, and that&#8217;s why it is recommended to such keeping campaigns just to save the rank you achieve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What about Apple? As you remember, the Apple algorithm is working faster and updating all the ranks faster so you can get the particular rank faster and do not wait like five-seven days like on Google for the rank updates. You can just add the installs and observe the increase over the next one to two days after all the installs have been delivered. So when you work with Apple, you actually can use this strategy when you add a particular amount of installs, You achieve the position, and then the next few days you just follow if the position is stable. If you see that it is stable, you can not continue installs and if you see that the position is actually starting to decrease and there are some changes, you can react and add the same number of installs to boost the keyword to the particular rank and in such a way as to follow the changes. Of course, for some keywords, both for Google Play and for the App Store, it may be needed to add installs to keep the position for a long period of time. Usually these are keywords of high popularity competitive keywords like “puzzle&#8221; or “drifting”. We understand that for such requests, there are a lot of apps aiming to occupy top one. So if you achieved the particular rank with such a keyword, it is highly recommended to conduct at least one campaign to keep the position, and then it may be possible also use some more campaigns with the half of the daily volume you used with 30% of the daily volume just to make sure that the reached rank will be saved for your application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And of course, do not forget to work with the ASO, try to update the App Store assets like icons and visuals all the time if you see that they do not convert into the install.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you achieved top rankings with some highly popular keywords, you may lose the position fast due to issues with the application itself or with the app&#8217;s reputation, for example, so before you are aiming to occupy top rankings for some highly trafficked keywords, make sure that the application is ready for this. You may have spent some funds for this, but after you may lost the position because there are other applications with the better conversion rates, for example, or with higher overall operating in the particular region.</p>

<p>We talk about featured reviews by Google. Unfortunately, no one knows which algorithm Google uses to push these reviews to the top, as they do not reveal it and there is no official information, but anyway, we can make some assumptions. First of all, it is important that the review be long and really consist of information directly connected with the application. Also, it is important for Google to see that the user who left the particular review actually entered the application, spent time there, and provided a kind of in-app activity, and according to this, most probably, Google put the reviews in the top spots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there is one more important thing here, which may be that the user account is important for Google. It is needed to see that actually the account is not fake and it is used to download different applications from Google Play as well as to leave the reviews for other apps or games. Previously it was also possible to get the review to the top with the help of likes but nowadays it is not possible so one of the main methods to remove negative reviews from the top is actually <a href="https://keyapp.top/buy-app-reviews">ordering positive reviews</a> but pay attention when you order positive reviews or try to write texts which are long and which consists of the detailed information about likes or dislikes about your application. In such a way you will show Google that the review is real</p>



<p>And actually, it can be put on top here, and of course, the more positive reviews an app gets, the more chances there are that some of them will go here to the top and actually replace the negative ones.</p>

<p>It is a kind of complex question, as category ranking depends not only on the number of installs the application gets. It is important to show Google Play or the App Store that the application is popular and has a lot of active users to get it onto some charts, like on Google Play for popular games, multiplayer games, or simulation games.</p>



<p>Anyway, it is also important to show Google Play that the application is qualitative. It means:</p>



<ul><li>There shouldn&#8217;t be any crushes inside the app, as this influences the app&#8217;s positions in categories and for keywords a lot. It influences the app Matrix and some of the success of any type of promotion you conduct.&nbsp;</li><li>It&#8217;s important to have good positions for search requests, because first of all, it shows that the application is popular, and high positions for search requests can bring your application organic traffic, which can increase in-app activity.</li><li>Both rating and reviews influence the conversion rate and in-app activity as well, and of course they influence the chances to occupy some high rungs in the category because, when Google creates this list, they pay attention to the rating and to the reviews, and it is needed to work with app reputation to increase both of them.</li></ul>



<p>These are some main tips, some main fields you should work with to be able to occupy some high rankings in the category, and just remember that only with the help of a lot of installs it is not possible to get some good positions in any category.</p>

<p>On our platform, you can verify all of the information required for keyword promotion of your application. I mean the app position for the keyword, keyword popularity, and the estimated traffic the keyword can bring. With all these details, you can analyze the results received from the promotion of our platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the &#8220;My keywords&#8221; section, you can add keywords and check the positions and charts. <strong>The main aim of keyword promotion is to get higher ranks for the search request and with this to attract more organic users</strong>. &nbsp;With these chariots, you can see how many positions the application increased during the time you ran the campaign with us.</p>



<p>One more thing you can analyze with the help of our platform is how many installs were received for a particular date or for a particular keyword. This can help you analyze how much you will spend and how many installs you will need to get the particular position for the needed search request. All installs are reflected in the developer console or App Store Connect, and you can also see if there is an increase in the number of organic users your app receives after reaching top rankings for high-traffic keywords.</p>

<p>There is a difference. When we are talking about some apps like fitness, dating, and casinos, it is easier to promote them because there are actually a lot of them on Google Play or the App Store, and either way, you can gather a lot of keywords for them to promote them for. But when it comes to games, if it is not a popular type of game like puzzles, sudoku, blocks, or a game with no competitors, it is extremely difficult to promote such games for keywords because you are unable to gather this keyword cloud to determine for which search requests this application can receive organic traffic. However, games can also be promoted using keywords, especially if they are a popular type of game from a popular category, such as puzzles, where the competition is quite high. As a result, the number of organic installs and traffic is also high.</p>
