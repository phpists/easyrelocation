<p>We talk about featured reviews by Google. Unfortunately, no one knows which algorithm Google uses to push these reviews to the top, as they do not reveal it and there is no official information, but anyway, we can make some assumptions. First of all, it is important that the review be long and really consist of information directly connected with the application. Also, it is important for Google to see that the user who left the particular review actually entered the application, spent time there, and provided a kind of in-app activity, and according to this, most probably, Google put the reviews in the top spots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there is one more important thing here, which may be that the user account is important for Google. It is needed to see that actually the account is not fake and it is used to download different applications from Google Play as well as to leave the reviews for other apps or games. Previously it was also possible to get the review to the top with the help of likes but nowadays it is not possible so one of the main methods to remove negative reviews from the top is actually <a href="https://keyapp.top/buy-app-reviews">ordering positive reviews</a> but pay attention when you order positive reviews or try to write texts which are long and which consists of the detailed information about likes or dislikes about your application. In such a way you will show Google that the review is real</p>



<p>And actually, it can be put on top here, and of course, the more positive reviews an app gets, the more chances there are that some of them will go here to the top and actually replace the negative ones.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The algorithms of both Stores work completely differently. And it&#8217;s applicable for indexation process, app optimization, keyword promotion and of course reviews. We would like to mention some things which are common for Google Play and App Store: Rating. Both Google Play and App Store show rating according to the country. So the overall app rating is different in different countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So when we are talking about reviews on Google Play, one important thing is that they divide reviews according to the region. So users from the USA will see the reviews from users who are also in the USA. <strong>But one more important thing here is that they also pay attention to device language. </strong>So if you are in the USA, for example and you have set your device language as English, you will see the reviews from users who also are in the USA and who also have their device language as English. This fact is extremely important when we are talking about <a href="https://keyapp.top/buy-app-reviews">buying reviews,</a> because when you buy some reviews on any service, of course you would like them to be seen by the particular group of users who can install or just view your application.<strong> And in such a way it is important to mention not only the region you would like to order the reviews from, but also it is important to point&nbsp; the device language you would like your reviews to be left from</strong>. Because if we are talking about Canada, reviews may be left from the devices with English device language. But also French is popular in Canada, so the main region may be Canada but device languages are different and of course different groups of users will see the reviews which you have bought.</p>



<p><strong>If we are talking about grouping of reviews on App Store, the situation is different and basically on the App Store only region is important. </strong>So if the region is Ukraine, they just show all the reviews of users who have left some feedback from Ukraine. So if you are in Ukraine you will see the reviews of ukrainian users without any connection to the device language, so they can have device language Ukrainian or English nevertheless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also one more important difference which is extremely important for App Store optimization and for the indexation process is that <strong>on Google Play the keywords which are added to the reviews are indexed. </strong>Of course they are not as important as the keywords which you add, for example to title or to short or long description. But anyway if you would like to add some keywords to indexation to get some positions in TOP -250, you can add reviews with necessary keywords. You can read more about <a href="https://keyapp.top/blog/app-promotion/how-to-buy-app-reviews/">How to buy Android or iOS reviews</a> safely.</p>
