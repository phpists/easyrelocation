<p>Unfortunately, there is no official data you may use to analyze this information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>First of all, you can check this information only for your own application in the Google Play developer console, so when you enter the application and go to conversion analysis, you can actually check for which keywords your application gets the highest number of downloads in the particular country. So this can actually help you, for example, in keyword promotion. If you see that the application is getting high volumes for a particular keyword and you understand that the position for this keyword is not top one but top 10, for example, you can use these keywords in keyword promotion campaigns to boost the ranks to top positions, and in such a way the amount of organic search traffic may even increase and become higher due to the fact that the application is occupying top one for now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when we are talking about the App Store, there is no way to check for which keywords your application is getting traffic, even in App Store Connect for your own application. First of all, you need to conduct competitor research. Let&#8217;s imagine that you have drifting application, so you just put the main keyword like “drifting”&nbsp; and actually analyzes all apps in search. It is needed for you to understand for which keywords each of these applications is in position one, or at least in position three if it is a game. So you can go, for example, to <a href="https://Appsmm.ru/">Keyapp</a>, use “Smart campaign,” and check all the apps for the indexed keywords. In such a way, you will know which keywords occupy the top ranks. So probably the applications are getting the search traffic exactly for these requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One more method is to analyze the text, such as to see which keywords are added to the title and short description, as these two fields are the most important and most probably the most trafficked keywords will be added there for some competitor apps. And you can use different app store optimization services that actually do the same thing but just show you the analyzed data. Pay attention to the fact that all this data is just assumptions because official information from both stores is unfortunately not possible to get.</p>

<p>The keywords are quite different, and the process of keyword promotion for different keywords is different as well,as are the results you may get. If you want to keep the position, it is necessary to set up the campaign even after you reach the top. The first step we need to do is evaluate for how many days it will be okay to set up the supporting campaign for the rank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So usually for Google Play, it is okay to set four- five- seven days and then check out the keyword behavior to see if there have been any changes in the rank. If we talk about the daily volume to use to keep the position, we recommend to continue campaign with approximately the same amount you have used for at least three to four days. And if you see that the rank doesn&#8217;t change, you can start to decrease this daily volume by 20-30% like once every two or three days. In this way, you will help the application stay at the top, because we understand that after the application achieves a particular rank, it is not certain that at once the organic downloads from the search will appear. It is needed to understand that for Google, it is needed some time to update the rank on all the device types for all the users, so organic downloads from the search may not appear at once, and that&#8217;s why it is recommended to such keeping campaigns just to save the rank you achieve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What about Apple? As you remember, the Apple algorithm is working faster and updating all the ranks faster so you can get the particular rank faster and do not wait like five-seven days like on Google for the rank updates. You can just add the installs and observe the increase over the next one to two days after all the installs have been delivered. So when you work with Apple, you actually can use this strategy when you add a particular amount of installs, You achieve the position, and then the next few days you just follow if the position is stable. If you see that it is stable, you can not continue installs and if you see that the position is actually starting to decrease and there are some changes, you can react and add the same number of installs to boost the keyword to the particular rank and in such a way as to follow the changes. Of course, for some keywords, both for Google Play and for the App Store, it may be needed to add installs to keep the position for a long period of time. Usually these are keywords of high popularity competitive keywords like “puzzle&#8221; or “drifting”. We understand that for such requests, there are a lot of apps aiming to occupy top one. So if you achieved the particular rank with such a keyword, it is highly recommended to conduct at least one campaign to keep the position, and then it may be possible also use some more campaigns with the half of the daily volume you used with 30% of the daily volume just to make sure that the reached rank will be saved for your application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And of course, do not forget to work with the ASO, try to update the App Store assets like icons and visuals all the time if you see that they do not convert into the install.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you achieved top rankings with some highly popular keywords, you may lose the position fast due to issues with the application itself or with the app&#8217;s reputation, for example, so before you are aiming to occupy top rankings for some highly trafficked keywords, make sure that the application is ready for this. You may have spent some funds for this, but after you may lost the position because there are other applications with the better conversion rates, for example, or with higher overall operating in the particular region.</p>

<p>It is a kind of complex question, as category ranking depends not only on the number of installs the application gets. It is important to show Google Play or the App Store that the application is popular and has a lot of active users to get it onto some charts, like on Google Play for popular games, multiplayer games, or simulation games.</p>



<p>Anyway, it is also important to show Google Play that the application is qualitative. It means:</p>



<ul><li>There shouldn&#8217;t be any crushes inside the app, as this influences the app&#8217;s positions in categories and for keywords a lot. It influences the app Matrix and some of the success of any type of promotion you conduct.&nbsp;</li><li>It&#8217;s important to have good positions for search requests, because first of all, it shows that the application is popular, and high positions for search requests can bring your application organic traffic, which can increase in-app activity.</li><li>Both rating and reviews influence the conversion rate and in-app activity as well, and of course they influence the chances to occupy some high rungs in the category because, when Google creates this list, they pay attention to the rating and to the reviews, and it is needed to work with app reputation to increase both of them.</li></ul>



<p>These are some main tips, some main fields you should work with to be able to occupy some high rankings in the category, and just remember that only with the help of a lot of installs it is not possible to get some good positions in any category.</p>

<p>On our platform, you can verify all of the information required for keyword promotion of your application. I mean the app position for the keyword, keyword popularity, and the estimated traffic the keyword can bring. With all these details, you can analyze the results received from the promotion of our platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the &#8220;My keywords&#8221; section, you can add keywords and check the positions and charts. <strong>The main aim of keyword promotion is to get higher ranks for the search request and with this to attract more organic users</strong>. &nbsp;With these chariots, you can see how many positions the application increased during the time you ran the campaign with us.</p>



<p>One more thing you can analyze with the help of our platform is how many installs were received for a particular date or for a particular keyword. This can help you analyze how much you will spend and how many installs you will need to get the particular position for the needed search request. All installs are reflected in the developer console or App Store Connect, and you can also see if there is an increase in the number of organic users your app receives after reaching top rankings for high-traffic keywords.</p>

<p>There is a difference. When we are talking about some apps like fitness, dating, and casinos, it is easier to promote them because there are actually a lot of them on Google Play or the App Store, and either way, you can gather a lot of keywords for them to promote them for. But when it comes to games, if it is not a popular type of game like puzzles, sudoku, blocks, or a game with no competitors, it is extremely difficult to promote such games for keywords because you are unable to gather this keyword cloud to determine for which search requests this application can receive organic traffic. However, games can also be promoted using keywords, especially if they are a popular type of game from a popular category, such as puzzles, where the competition is quite high. As a result, the number of organic installs and traffic is also high.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If all things like the title, short and long description, screenshots, and icon are already done but the application is not indexed for keywords anyway.</p>



<p>If we are speaking about Google Play, remember that it needs some time to get into the index for the keywords to show your application for search requests; do not wait to get into the index for the keywords all at once over several days. Usually Google Play needs one to two weeks, sometimes three weeks, to put your application in the top 250 for the keywords.</p>



<p>Secondly, it is needed to show Google Play that the application starts to get some installs and there are some in-app activities; this can help Google&#8217;s algorithm start the indexation process. To help with this process, you can order some installs from CPI campaigns. <strong>Users will install your app only if they like it. That means you will attract people who generate in-app activity and income for you. This can assist Google in understanding that the specific application, which is not indexed for the keywords, has some activity, and it is high time to include it in the list of apps for some low-popularity and low-traffic keywords. </strong>In most cases, at the first step, the application will be indexed for some long-tail keywords such as &#8220;drifting car games,&#8221; &#8220;drifting car games offline,&#8221; and &#8220;drifting games with hand braid.&#8221;</p>



<ul><li>While some installs are received by the app, you just need to follow all the changes in your app positions for the keywords. For example, on our platform, you can do it completely for free <a href="https://Appsmm.ru/">using &#8220;Smart Campaign,&#8221; </a>which can help you get a list of keywords your application is already indexed for in the particular country.</li><li>If we&#8217;re talking about Google Play, it is important to remember that the algorithm also checks screenshots and reviews. So you can order some reviews with keywords added to their text, and in such a way, Google will go to the review section and check all the feedback the application has. If some keywords are added, this also increases the app&#8217;s chances of being indexed for the keyword.</li></ul>



<p>When you optimize the Apple application, I would like to draw your attention to some mistakes that can be made. It is important to remember that for Apple, it is completely enough if you add the keyword once in one field, which it checks to get the index for the keywords. Remember that Apple checks the title, subtitle, and keyword fields, which are not seen on the App Store, but it is seen in App Store Connect. It is the field where only developers can add the keywords associated with their application. It is completely enough to use one keyword once in one field, for example, only in the title or only in the keyword field. Also, one more mistake about the keyword field: do not put the whole phrases there. You can just separate the different words with a comma, and the app store will create the keywords based on the results.</p>



<p>The most important thing for the App Store is when you add some keywords to the text metadata, and keep in mind that the App Store does not check the screenshots for keywords with the goal of indexing the app, as well as the long description. Also, it doesn&#8217;t check the reviews. So, basically, the number of tools you have is related to in-app activity and some promotion of already-indexed keywords.<strong> It is important to mention that on Google Play, the indexation process takes even one, two, or three weeks, but on the App Store, this process is much faster, and basically, when you add the application to the store, you can already observe some keywords indexing over several days.</strong></p>



<ul><li>After learning the application on the App Store, it is critical to track all changes with the keywords you have, because it is necessary to catch the moment when the application is ranked for the specific search request and begin the promotion to fix the position. Because one app store gives this boost, of course they give some low positions close to 200–250, and our aim in such a case is just to catch this moment and fix the position with at least the top 50 to be able to promote it further.</li><li><strong>If you want to get into the index for some keywords, you should use App Store optimization as your primary tool, along with some additional traffic to show App Store that the application is becoming more popular, and of course, you get the moment when some keywords are already indexed for the specific application.</strong></li></ul>
