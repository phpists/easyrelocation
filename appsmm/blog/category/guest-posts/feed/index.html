<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>1. In-App Purchases:</strong></h3>



<p>In-app purchases are those paid features or content available inside the app. It can be of broad categories such as gaming avatars, coins, levels, and lives, or unique features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also offer a subscription to your app users, giving them access to all the premium content for a certain period. The future of in-app purchases seems to be headed towards microtransactions, where users can pay for small digital goods and services inside the app.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>2. Sponsors and Partnerships:</strong></h3>



<p>You can collaborate with other brands or businesses and offer in-app sponsorships. For example, a gaming app can feature another business&#8217;s product inside the game. Similarly, a news app can feature stories from partners or collaborators.</p>



<p>It is a win-win app monetization strategy because it helps you get revenue from the sponsor while also providing value to your app users. Moreover, it helps app owners build a customer base that is interested in the products or services of their sponsors.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>3. App Advertising:</strong></h3>



<p>You can run ads inside your app and get paid every time a user views or clicks on the ad. There are different types of ad formats that you can try inside your app, such as banner ads, interstitial ads, video ads, native ads, and so on.</p>



<p>Choosing the correct ad format that does not disrupt the user experience inside your app is essential. Moreover, you should keep track of the number of ads you show to the users, as too many ads can lead to user fatigue and, eventually you may lose quality users.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>4. SMS Marketing:</strong></h3>



<p>Most marketers overlook the power of SMS marketing. However, it is one of the most effective ways to reach out to your app users and promote offers, discounts, or new content. You can use an in-app messaging platform to send targeted messages to your app users and promote whatever you want.</p>



<p>The best part about SMS marketing is that the open rates are pretty high compared to other marketing channels. Moreover, it is a permission-based marketing channel, meaning the users have to opt-in to receive messages from you.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Running A Freemium Model:</strong></h3>



<p>Freemium is the most exciting and customer-centric way of monetizing an app. In this model, you offer a basic version of your app for free and charge users for premium features. This is a great way to let users try your app before they make a purchase.</p>



<p>The key to making this model work is to offer enough value in the free version so that users are compelled to upgrade to the paid version. Moreover, it would help if you also provided a 14-day or 30-day free trial of the premium version to let users experience the value before they make a purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While building a freemium model, ensure you have a solid retention and conversion strategy.</p>

You can lock certain pieces of content and only unlock them when the user completes an action, such as watching a video ad.</p>



<p>Another way to monetize content-based apps is to offer a subscription model where users can access all the premium content by paying a monthly or yearly fee. As your app gets popular and builds a loyal user base, you can start charging for premium content. Some key premium content options are infographics, e-books, reports, etc.</p>
